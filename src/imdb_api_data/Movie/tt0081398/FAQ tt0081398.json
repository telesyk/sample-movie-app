      "question": "Why is this film in B&W?",
      "answer": "According to Martin Scorsese's the DVD commentary, when first screening some test 8mm footage of Robert De Niro sparring in a ring, he felt that something was off about the image. Michael Powell, who at that time had become something of a mentor and good friend to Scorsese, suggested that it was the color of the gloves that was throwing them off. Realizing this was true, Scorsese then decided the movie had to be filmed in black and white. In the commentary, they said they had to change the color to a dull brownish so they could get it approved with so much blood. They also mentioned that as being one of the reasons Raging Bull was not shot in colorâ€”too much blood even for an R rating."

      "question": "Why was Joey mad at Jake because he beat him up when he was accused to have slept with his brother's wife?",
      "answer": "He never slept with his sister-in-law. Jake was paranoid that she slept with everyone, and basically drove her to the point of admitting something that wasn't true. She said it to shut him up, and Joey was beat up. But Jake obviously believed it enough no matter."
