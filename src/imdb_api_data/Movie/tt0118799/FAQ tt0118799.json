      "question": "What is the answer to Dr. Lessing's final riddle?",
      "answer": "In an interview, Roberto Benigni said the riddle has no solution-that it was nonsensical to point up the ridiculousness of the situation. A possible answer does exist, and it's \"a jew\". The initial part of the riddle, in Italian, is Grasso grasso, brutto brutto / tutto giallo in verità: / se mi chiedi dove sono / ti rispondo \"Qua qua qua\". (Translation: Fat fat, ugly ugly / truly all yellow / If you ask me where I am / I answer \"Quack quack quack\".) The only answer Dr. Lessing proposed is \"duck\", but he knows it's wrong. There is a double meaning of the word \"qua\". \"Qua!\", in italian, is the cry of a duck, but it also means \"here!\". And the word \"here\" answers to the question contained in the previous verse. In English the riddle is meaningless, but in Italian it can be quite shocking, if one accepts the alternative explanation. To the eyes of a Nazi, the stereotype of a Jew is a fat, ugly person with a yellow skin."
