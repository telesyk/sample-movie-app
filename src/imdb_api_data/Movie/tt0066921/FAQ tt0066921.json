      "question": "why is it that even though the film is set in the future, it still seems to have a distinct 1970's look and feel to it.",
      "answer": "Because...it was MADE in the 70s? and they did not have time machines to go to the future in the 00s and make it \"up to date\"? The future is only how far you can see at any given time!\""

      "question": "Why did Dim & Georgie turn on Alex?",
      "answer": "They hardly parted good friends as they were responsible for bottling him before his arrest and when they met after his release from jail the two police officers were living up to their adopted role as anti that which Alex still represented to them hence it was natural that this dislike and their new role would quite naturally lead to their assaulting him.we are what we do and act accordingly"

      "question": "What is 'A Clockwork Orange' about?",
      "answer": "British teenager Alex DeLarge (), leader of a gang of \"droogs\"—Pete (Michael Tarn), Georgie (James Marcus), and Dim (Warren Clarke)—who spend their evenings committing \"ultra-violent\" crimes, is apprehended by the police, convicted of rape and murder, and sentenced to 14 years in prison. While incarcerated, Alex volunteers for the Ludovico procedure—a government-developed program that professes to cure him of his violent tendencies. However, they didn't warn Alex that the cure might be worse than the disease. Edit"

      "question": "Is \"A Clockwork Orange\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "A Clockwork Orange is a novel written by English author John Burgess Wilson (pen name: Anthony Burgess) and published in 1962."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the story set in the future or an alternate reality?",
      "answer": "Many people assume it is set in the future largely based on inconclusive points. Alex and his droogs steal a \"Derango 95\", which many people assume is something like saying, \"a '57 Chevy\". In the book when Alex and his droogs beat up a bum, he mentions men walking on the moon, which in the context of the book's publication in 1962, would have seemed very far into the future. (Curiously, this line is retained in the movie, which was produced after the first Moon landings). However, Anthony Burgess was well known as a satirist, and many of his books (like The Right to an Answer, Devil of a State, and 1985) are satirical comments on the absurdities of the world. Given the nature of his work it is more likely this story is set in an alternate world. The \"Derango 95\" could follow the European practice of using numbers (a Mercedes 450), instead of names (a Ford Thunderbird), to distinguish a particular car model. The fact that teenagers would speak in a Russian slang, or listen to songs by Russian pop stars, wouldn't happen in a future Britain, but would in an alternate world. And it isn't possible that any government in the real world would sanction something as tortuous as the Ludovico procedure.This point is made clear by Burgess in an interview published in Playboy (Sept. 1974): \" It's fallacious to believe that there's such a thing as a fiction of the future. Any fiction that seems to be set in a future time is really set in the present, with a few fantastic embellishments that the writer can allow himself. ... Clockwork Orange is a satirical study of life as it was in 1960, when the tone of postwar England was socialistic, collectivist, and I was really trying to satirize that sort of world in which people had nothing to live for, had no energy--except for the young, who could do nothing with their energy but employ it to totally barbarous ends. I was really writing about the present. The then present. The now past. The future is already in the past. In Clockwork Orange, I had world telecasts and men on the moon. Of course, these things have come true; but there's nothing in the book that wasn't already present in the technology of the early Sixties, except for the use of a composite dialect called Nadsat.\" It's interesting to note that in the film, on the mocked up newspaper Alex's parents are reading, the front cover reports it's circulation growth from August 1969 - August 1970. This suggests that Kubrick set his version in an alternative 1970 rather than some vague 'future Britain'."

    {
      "question": "How old is Alex supposed to be?",
      "answer": "In the book, Alex is 15 years old at the beginning, 17 when he gets out of jail, and by the time of the book's end, he's 18."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it called \"A Clockwork Orange\"?",
      "answer": "The simple answer is that it is derived from an old English expression \"Queer as a Clockwork Orange\", meaning something very strange. In the novel, when Alex and his friends attack the writer and his wife, the writer is working on a manuscript entitled \"A Clockwork Orange\", but this was left out of the movie. However, in a 1986 Introduction to the first American edition of the book to contain the final chapter, Anthony Burgess says \"A human being is endowed with free will. He can use this to choose between good and evil. If he can only perform good or only perform evil, then he is a clockwork orange—meaning that he has the appearance of an organism lovely with colour and juice but is in fact only a clockwork toy to be wound up by God or the Devil.\" He goes on to say \"the important thing is moral choice.\" When Alex cannot choose to perform good or evil (after the Ludovico treatment), he has become a clockwork orange. Burgess also states that the Malaysian word \"orang\" means \"man\" in English, so \"A Clockwork Orange\" means \"a clockwork man\", which is what Alex has become by the end of the film, figuratively."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do Alex and his droogs drink milk?",
      "answer": "The milk has drugs in it. If you listen closely, Alex names all the drugs during the opening scene: \"The Korova Milk Bar sells Milk Plus: milk plus synthemesc, vellocet, or drencrom, which is what we were drinking. This will sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultraviolence.\" You can also see the names of the drugs spelled out on the walls of the Bar behind them in the first shot. Novelist Anthony Burgess has stated that Alex drinking milk is symbolic of his infantile, child-like nature. \"Synthemesc\" is synthetic mescaline; \"vellocet\" is methedrine/speed, and \"drencrom\" is adrenochrome, all very powerful drugs which would cause the user to lose impulse control. Both mescaline and adrenochrome act as hallucinogens, and in addition, adrenochrome can amplify the effects of methedrine, making them the perfect additives for ultra-violence."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's that weird language they speak?",
      "answer": "It's called Nadsat. It's a language the author made up for the book, largely comprised of phonetically pronounced Russian words. The word nadsat itself is the Russian suffix for \"-teen\". Burgess was a linguist, and aware of the evolution of slang, did not want Alex and his Droogs to use (then) contemporary slang terms for fear of the book becoming dated. He used his knowledge of Russian to create the imaginary street-jargon used by the gangs as a way of ensuring that this would not happen. When the book was translated into Russian, the Russian words were replaced with their English counterparts; ironically, at the time, the Russian subculture equivalent to American hippies already spoke in a similar jargon, giving the book another (albeit unintentional) layer. Early American mass-market paperback editions of the book had a nadsat glossary in the back. The newer trade-paperback edition eliminated the glossary."

    {
      "question": "Did Alex only get 14 years for murder?",
      "answer": "A life sentence in the United Kingdom is 14 years at minimum. After that, the prisoner may be paroled or released at the court's discretion, but until that happens they will remain in prison indefinitely. In extreme cases, life can mean exactly that: life imprisonment, with no chance for parole. As Alex's crime was vicious, he would have served the full 14 year sentence. Because the attack on the woman was premeditated, the charge would have been most likely have been murder, not manslaughter which carries a shorter term of imprisonment. Although the charge theoretically could have been reduced to manslaughter (the assault on the woman was indeed premeditated, but the murder itself was accidental), the fact that Alex was willing to undergo the Ludovico treatment rather than just wait out his sentence points to a murder conviction."
    },
    {
      "question": "Were the women from the record store/woman at the end raped?",
      "answer": "No, they followed Alex back to his room and undressed willingly. The woman at the end is on top, and isn't trying to get away. But in the book, the girls are very young (10 years old), and Alex got them drunk and raped them."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about the masturbation scene?",
      "answer": "Some people don't believe there is one, but most believe when Alex listens to Beethoven in his room after the rape, he's masturbating. In the book, it's made clear he's naked during this part, but he also says that his hands were behind his head. McDowell's commentary track on the 2007 DVD release sheds a bit more light on this issue: He mentions that he wasn't masturbating and that it wasn't Kubrick's intention. Malcolm says that he was just taking his boots off, hence the movement of his shoulders. However, it can still be implied that Alex was gratifying himself."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Alex have to stand behind the white line while registering in prison if he could barely reach the podium?",
      "answer": "It's a method of humiliation. The guards are deliberately making Alex look submissive and are conditioning him to the rules of the prison. If Alex steps out of line, either consciously or unconsciously, he'll be reprimanded or punished."
    },
    {
      "question": "If the \"Singin' in the Rain\" bit was added just before filming, how was the writer originally supposed to find out that Alex is the guy who assaulted him and his wife?",
      "answer": "In the film, Stanley Kubrick originally planned for F. Alexander () to discover that Alex was the person who raped his wife by having Alex mention the word \"Horrorshow.\" Alex would have been talking, and would have said \"Horrorshow\" in the conversation, making F. Alexander suspicious, and finally he would have realized who Alex really was after getting Alex to repeat the word again and again. However, this was changed on set, just before filming. In the book, the writer finds out because Alex has knowledge of the house when he is taken in. Specifically, Alex expresses his surprise when the author says he will call his friends on a telephone (Remember, the first thing said to Alex in the first encounter was that they didn't have a telephone). From there, the author puts the pieces together from further conversation with Alex, finally realizing the truth after Alex gets upset at the mention of the word \"dim\". This is when F. Alexander starts to become really suspicious—when Alex mistakenly mentions the word \"dim\" and the writer remembers that name. Edit"

    {
      "question": "What is the model of the car that Alex & the Droogs drive around before they attack the writer and his wife?",
      "answer": "Alex calls the car a \"Durango '95\" but it's actually a 1970 M-505 Adams Brothers Probe 16. The car was one of only three prototypes built and is one of the rarest cars in the world."
    },
    {
      "question": "What became of Pete, the third of Alex's \"droogs\"?",
      "answer": "In the film, it is never made clear where Pete ends up. We learn that Georgie and Dim have gone on to become police officers, who take their first opportunity to beat Alex within an inch of his life (post-treatment, Alex can no longer defend himself, which is public knowledge via the newspapers), but the subject of Pete is never revisited. In the original novel (The film version uses the original U.S. issue of the book, that removes chapter 21, the final chapter, which is why you don't see Pete after Alex's treatment in the film), Alex has a chance encounter with Pete (who is almost 20 years old) and finds that his former droog has grown up quite a bit: He's found a woman with whom to settle down and no longer speaks in Nadsat. According to Burgess' vision, this makes Alex question his path and purpose. This takes place after Alex has declared himself \"cured\", and has returned to a life of crime with a new set of Droogs. Seeing his old friend Pete all grown up and living a normal life, Alex is driven to consider giving up his days as a thug and cleaning up his act once and for all. This gives the faithful reader a sense of a moral that is not presented in the original U.S. release of the novel, and therefore the film, that \"one cannot be forced to change, but one must decide to change on their own\". Also, in the novel, Georgie dies whilst Alex is in prison (while trying to escape a robbery, he trips and a man beats him to death), and the other policemen with Dim that beats up Alex is in fact, Billy Boy (the gang leader Alex and his Droogs have a fight with near the start)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did McDowell almost drown in the \"trough\" scene?",
      "answer": "It has been written in the past that Malcolm McDowell nearly drowned in the trough scene, where his former droogs, Georgie and Dim, dunk him into an animal trough filled with dirty water and beat him with a nightstick for nearly a minute of screen time. The rumour was that McDowell's breathing apparatus failed. This isn't true. In the Warner Brothers DVD, McDowell does a commentary track and talks about how he used an oxygen tank while he was under the water. He never mentions that it failed or that he almost drowned. Also on one of the documentaries on the DVD, the commentator mentions that McDowell did 28 takes of that scene, so the tank must have been working.What is true is that the water was colored brown with a special food additive derived from beef production and that McDowell found it really noxious to work in."

    {
      "question": "Why wasn't Alex affected by his singing of \"Singin' in the Rain\" in the Writer's bathtub after being brought into the Writer's house in the last third of the film?",
      "answer": "We all know that the improvisation of \"Singin' in the Rain\" during the rape of the Writer's wife was an on-the-set decision by Malcolm McDowell but why didn't he get sick whenever he absent mindedly began to sing the song while in the bathtub after being brought in to safety into the Writer's house near the end of the film? We have to look at the reason he should have gotten sick in the first place: The Ludevico Treatment. We know that Alex was shocked when, during the treatment sessions, he heard Beethoven's music during the footage of Nazi Germany. That means that Alex's mind began to relate the music of Beethoven to violence. The connection of Beethoven to violence is used by the Writer in the torturing of Alex near the end of the film. But since the Beethoven / violence connection is used, what about \"Singin in the Rain\"? Should Alex have gotten sick, as it was related to an actual act of sexual violence in the film itself? It is questionable, but Alex should have gotten sick, like the writer quivering in sickness hearing the song from Alex for the second time. This could have been an oversight of Stanley Kubrick himself.When we look at the novel, we get much more of the effects from the administration of the Ludevico Treatment. Alex couldn't listen to any music, of any type, at all. He also couldn't read the Bible any more either, due to the sex and violence contained within the good book, which was the reason that Alex began reading the Bible in jail (before starting the treatment) in the first place. Since many of the goofs in the film are \"intentional\" goofs by Kubrick himself and intended to disorient the viewer, this one would be an oversight by Kubrick, and not a flaw to confuse people who watch the film."

    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "When it comes to light that the government is responsible for Alex's attempted suicide due to their attempts at brainwashing him as a means of crime reform, the newspapers and public opinion take an unfavorable view of the government's attempt at changing Alex's inherent nature. After a period of psychological manipulation and testing, Alex is visited in the hospital by the Interior Minister (), who promises to take good care of him, find him a well-paying job, and compensate him for his suffering. In return, Alex promises to consider the government a friend and to help change public opinion of them. The minister then presents Alex with large bouquets of flowers and a large stereo system blasting Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, while multiple photographers takes photos of Alex and the Minster chumming it up together. In the final scene, Alex fantasizes having sex while \"the public\" watches and applauds. In a voiceover, Alex exclaims, \"I was cured, all right!\" Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happened during Alex's dream that people were playing around in his head?",
      "answer": "It wasn't a dream, the doctors and nurses were in his head, fixing his treatment, so he'd no longer get sick at the thought of sex and violence. The Ludovico treatment was being blasted by the media as inhumane and the doctors were trying to restore Alex to his former demeanor."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did Alex go back to his old ways at the end?",
      "answer": "That's left ambiguous in the film, however he was given back the power to choose to do good or evil. That's what he means by \"I was cured alright.\" In the book, he joins a new gang of droogs after he was cured, but later decides that it might be time to give up this lifestyle, get married and settle down."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Alex's real surname DeLarge or Burgess?",
      "answer": "Despite the newspapers giving his last name as \"Burgess,\" it appears that \"Alexander DeLarge\" is his real name. While some viewers believe Alex to be mocking the prison authorities by giving this as his name, both Mr. Alexander and the Minister of the Interior refer to him as \"Mr. DeLarge\" at various points in the film, indicating that this is his real name. The \"Burgess\" seen in newspapers was simply an inside joke by Kubrick, a reference to Anthony Burgess."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the man who helps Frank Alexander in the end his lover?",
      "answer": "No. Julian () is just there because Frank Alexander was afraid to be alone after the rape and death of his wife. Julian was a bodyguard as well as a helpmate strong enough to carry him in his wheelchair. According to Prowse, he and Patrick Magee were not told specifically by Kubrick what their relationship was, so they played it under the assumption that Julian was a close relative, possibly Alexander's nephew. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it true Kubrick changed the ending of the book?",
      "answer": "No. The original version of the book has 21 chapters. Back in 1962, the American publisher decided not to include the last chapter, as the novel would then finish on an ambiguous note. Burgess, whilst not pleased at the interference, accepted the change. Kubrick's film was adapted from the version of the book published in the United States, and therefore the movie has a different ending. The novel was eventually released in a new edition that restored the last chapter."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was this film banned in the UK?",
      "answer": "Contrary to popular belief, A Clockwork Orange was never banned in the UK. The BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) classified it as an X-rating in 1971. When first released, many people in Britain were disgusted by the film as the sexual violence was considered to be extreme. Throughout 1972 and 1973, several violent crimes in Britain were said to be influenced by the film. These included an old man beaten to death in an underpass, a sixteen year old boy wearing Alex's uniform beating up a younger boy and a young woman raped by men chanting 'Singing in the Rain'. With pressure on director Stanley Kubrick to ban the film, Kubrick withdrew A Clockwork Orange from British cinemas in 1973. He said that the film would only be allowed to be seen after his death. During the 1980s and '90s, the only way in which British fans could see the film was if they ordered it on VHS from other countries, usually France. In 1993, the Scala Cinema club in London screened the film without Kubrick's permission. At Kubrick's insistence, Warner Bros sued the Scala club causing them to become bankrupt and eventually close. Stanley Kubrick died in 1999 and the movie was re-classified with an 18-rating by the BBFC. A Clockwork Orange was eventually re-released in British cinemas in 2000 and released on VHS and DVD in the UK later that year."

    {
      "question": "Why is this rated X?",
      "answer": "At the time it was released, the ratings system was quite different than it is now. The only ratings were \"G (General)\", \"M (Mature)\", \"R (Restricted)\", and \"X\" (extreme or crossing the line). \"M\" and \"R\" were roughly synonymous—both denoted \"adult\" content, with anyone being admitted to M-rated films and R-rated films requiring an adult to accompany anyone under 16 years old. X-rated films were those considered \"too extreme\" for anyone under 16, and denoted that theaters were not to permit anyone under the age of 16 even with a guardian. To this end, the sexual violence featured in the first thirty minutes of the film, and the \"Ludovico Treatment\" rape footage, were considered too graphic for anyone under 16 to see, hence the \"X\" rating. Because the X rating was not copyrighted by the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), it could be used by any film distributor, and the adult film industry began to self-rate its own films \"X\" in order to avoid having to submit them to the MPAA for rating and face the films being banned outright due to anti-pornography laws in the early 1970s. Soon, the \"X\" became a marketing tool for the pornography industry, with (imaginary) ratings of XX and XXX being given to adult films by their producers to denote levels of sexual \"extremity.\" In response, the MPAA, for all intents and purposes, ceased using the X rating for non-pornographic films; A Clockwork Orange and Midnight Cowboy, two mainstream films which had been given the X rating for sexually explicit content (only to win rave critical reviews) were summarily re-rated R without any changes made to their content. In 1972, the \"M\" rating was replaced by \"PG\", marking a clearer middle-ground between \"G\" and \"R\" than the \"M\" rating had indicated. (Trivia: The MPAA's NC-17 rating [\"No Children 17 years old or younger\"] has more or less come to supplant the uncopyrighted X rating.)"
