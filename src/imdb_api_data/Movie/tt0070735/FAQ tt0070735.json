      "question": "Why did the TV series Hustle copy the exact same scam?",
      "answer": "OK, some people might think it's great to see this scam repeated 40 years later on TV. But, like Only Fools and Horses and Fawlty Towers, it was good AT THE TIME and not necessary to reconstruct or repeat it 40 years later."

      "question": "How could such a huge con team possibly get away with such an operation in the The Sting?",
      "answer": "It's not 100% realistic for the entire team to pull off such a big operation (the failed Gunpowder Plot only involved 15-20 people), but everyone involved in the con is either a current or retired con artist, many of whom are personal friends of Gondorff or his associates. Everyone also knows that if anyone ratted on the operation, Lonnigan would likely kill the entire team."

      "question": "Is this movie based on a book?",
      "answer": "The Sting is based on a 1973 screenplay by American movie director David S. Ward who was inspired by some real-life con games perpetrated by brothers Fred and Charley Gondorf and documented by David Maurer in his book The Big Con: The Story of the Confidence Man. The Sting won the 1974 Academy Award for Best Motion Picture."

      "question": "What part did the Erie Kid play in the first con that earned him a share of the money?",
      "answer": "Erie () was the one who \"mugged\" Luther (Robert Earl Jones) and gave Hooker (Robert Redford) a reason to decline Luther's invitation to carry his money to the fake drop-off location. Establishing the \"mugging\" also gave Matolla (James Sloyan) the chance to be a hero and provide Luther with a reason to trust him with his money and then to swindle it from him in the \"switch\" inside the hankies. Erie's role may not have been as great as Hooker's or Luther's but it was critical to the overall con. Edit"

      "question": "If Lonnegan was born in Five Points (NYC), why does he have a thick Irish brogue? Robert Shaw was from Northwest England and for the role of Doyle Lonnegan in The Sting that's the accent he chose.",
      "answer": "Just because someone is born somewhere doesn't mean they grew up there too. Lonnegan might have been born in Five Points but he could have grown up elsewhere (in a place where his accent is common). Also, the Five Points district in New York City was a low income area, usually inhabited by immigrants. Those immigrants could have been Irish, Italian or even Jewish. Another film that deals with Irish immigrants in Five Points is . Edit"

    {
      "question": "Why didn't Lonnegan know who Hooker was, despite having ordered him killed?",
      "answer": "This is an indicator of two aspects of Lonnegan's character. First, that he could order the murder of someone who he is so disassociated from that he doesn't even know what they look like. Secondly, that Lonnegan is such a \"big fish\" that he doesn't know about the day to day operations conducted by, and carnage inflicted by, his organization.It could also be argued that Lonnegan should have figured out who Hooker was as he dropped him off at his house where Riley and Cole (two of Lonnegan's hitman) were waiting for him. Hooker was dropped off across the way from the complex and the car drove forward and the back windows of Lonnegan's car have shades covering the back windows. Hooker walked across the street with caution to make sure he wasn't being followed. It's also likely that Riley and Cole didn't get a good look at Hooker since the hall was dark and Hooker turned back and ran thus not being able to see Hooker and when they all got to the street Hooker was gone. Thus Riley could not accurately depict Hooker to Lonnegan or Combs."

      "question": "They seemed to have an awful lot of overhead for a half million payout. Is it worth it?",
      "answer": "This is in the midst of the Great Depression. A half million dollars is a lot of money even now. Another way to look at it is that $500,000 in 1935 would be equal to over 8 million in 2011 dollars. Back then it would have been a great fortune, more than enough to cover the renting of furniture and the time of the couple dozen extras needed to pull off the con, still leaving enough left over for the main players to split."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does \"flat rate\" mean?",
      "answer": "When they are renting furniture in order to set up betting salon, they offer the renter his choice of a percentage or a flat rate. When he hears that the mark is Doyle Lonnegan he insists on a flat rate. A percentage would be a share of the take. It promises more money but is, of course, only payable if they succeed in the con. A flat rate is a set up front payment. When he hears that Lonnegan is the mark, the renter assumes that either the con will fail or that the guys pulling it off will be killed soon afterwards and will be unable to pay him his money, so he insists on payment up front"

      "question": "Any recommendations for movies similar to \"The Sting\"?",
      "answer": "If movies about con jobs is what you are after, check out (2003), in which a grifter attempts to pull the biggest con of his life against a banker with ties to the mob. In House of Games (1987) (1987), a psychiatrist finds herself involved in running cons during poker games. In Miller's Crossing (1990) (1999), two crime factions rival and a good-hearted guy gets caught in between trying to keep the peace. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988) (1988), while more of a comedy, pits two cons against each other when they decide that a small town on the French Mediterranean coast isn't big enough for the two of them. The BBC series Hustle (2004) (2004) was also heavily influenced by the film, even imitating some of the cons and elements in episodes. Edit"

      "question": "Why were all the FBI goons wearing straw boaters when nobody else was? Was that part of their dress code at the time?",
      "answer": "For the 1930's most FBI special agents dressed in a suit, tie and hat. Usually a fedora or yes occasionally a straw boater if it went well with their clothing. As to why they are all wearing straw boaters in the film was likely a choice by director George Roy Hill to make them stand out, and group them together and let the audience know these were not just ordinary men or police officers.It is also relieved at the end of the film that the FBI agents are not real FBI agents, but in fact members of a con led by Special Agent Polk (who's real name is revealed as Hickey by Henry Gondorff). Henceforth in the film world, the suits were picked up or stolen and they all came with matching suits and hats due not only to the budget, but how they could convince Lonnegan and Snyder that the deal was real and that they were there to bust a illegal track betting parlor. It should also be noted that Gondorff is wanted by the FBI and having the FBI bust them would make sense since to both Lonnegan and Snyder and with Polk being in charge, it would be easier for him to control Snyder due to chain of command. So likely everyone dresses the same to look formal and stand out amongst the large crowd in the place."

      "question": "Why do Gondorff and Hooker fake their deaths?",
      "answer": "As the con comes to it's close and Doyle Lonnegan bets $500,000 on a horse named Lucky Dan to win. When he learns that the horse is gonna come in second and he would loose his money. He demands his money back at which moment the FBI agents led by Agent Polk and Snyder bust the place and begin to search everyone. Then Polk prepares to take Henry Gondorff into custody and lets Johnny Hooker go. Since part of the set-up is to make it look as though Hooker betrayed Gondorff. Gondorff then shoots Hooker forcing Polk to use deadly force to shoot down Gondorff. Thus the two men are supposably dead. Then Snyder and Lonnegan leave and both men get up unharmed and all is revealed to be fake.The reason they did it this way rather than just leave and leave Lonnegan clueless is because Doyle Lonnegan is a gangster who is very prideful in his money. Whenever his pride is hurt or someone double-crosses him he resorts to murdering the people responsible. He already wanted Hooker dead (however he likely dosen't know Mr. Kelly is really Hooker). Also when he figures. out that he was coned which is highly likely due to how passionate he was about getting his money. He will want Gondorff and Hooker killed and won't rest until they are both dead. By faking their death's it will convince Lonnegan that they are dead, and thus won't go for revenge against the two. It is uncertain if he would go after everyone involved since it would be hard to track them down and would create a bigger mess. Henceforth he usually goes for the main people responsible.Another reason would be so Lt. Snyder (who takes bribes from Hooker to keep quiet). Would stop hunting for Hooker since Hooker cheated him by paying him $2,000 in counterfeit. Snyder then goes on a revenge mission to get Hooker and bring him to his so called justice by turning him into Lonnegan. If they got Hooker it would make it easier for him to get Gondorff since he is wanted by the FBI. Henceforth with both dead he would stop pegging Hooker for the money and Gondorff would remain free.Faking their deaths was the only way to make sure they kept the money, and avoid any reprisal from Lonnegan and get Snyder off everyone's back. While it seems like going very far and very illegal, it was the only way to ensure the con worked and they got even."
