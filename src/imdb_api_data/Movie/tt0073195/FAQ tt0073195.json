      "question": "Hooper tells Quint that he's \"crewed three Transpacs\". What does he mean?",
      "answer": "Hooper is trying to prove his sailing experience to Quint, who clearly doesn't like Hooper and doesn't want him joining the hunt for the shark. \"Transpac\" is short for \"trans-Pacific\", meaning a competitive ocean voyage on a large yacht that took him across the Pacific Ocean, likely from San Diego to Honolulu. Though it's not obvious at first, Hooper is quite an experienced sailor and the fact that he joined the crews of at least 3 Tranpacs is proof of it.Quint, however, seems unimpressed, and even mispronounces the word as \"transplants\". He also seems fairly unfazed when Hooper is able to tie the knot Quint ordered him too, a task that Hooper completes effortlessly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Quint call great whites 'porkers'?",
      "answer": "He calls them that because of their girth. By comparison a great white is much wider than other sharks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happened to \"Pippit\"?",
      "answer": "Presumably he was eaten by the shark, though this occurs offscreen."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was it necessary for Hooper and Brody to join Quint for the shark hunting?",
      "answer": "The non personal reasons were the following: while Hooper was a special government envoy, due to his expertise, Brody had to make sure Quint did the job for which he was paid"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Quint hate sharks?",
      "answer": "One has to think that Quint's attitude towards sharks was shaped entirely by his status as a survivor of the USS Indianapolis disaster near the end of WWII in the Pacific. As he recounts to Brody and Hooper on board the Orca, the Indianapolis had just delivered parts of the \"Little Boy\" atomic bomb that was eventually dropped on Hiroshima. She was torpedoed on her way back and sank, leaving over 900 men in the water, exposed to multiple hazards, shark attacks among them. Long story short, Quint has no qualms about hunting and killing sharks based on this trauma. Quint views sharks as merciless killers and feels that by hunting them, he's getting revenge for his fallen comrades."
    },
    {
      "question": "Were the Brody's expecting Hooper for dinner? Seems like he showed up unexpectedly with two bottles of wine at dinner time.",
      "answer": "No, they weren't expecting him. Hooper arrived at the Brody's because he needed to speak with Martin. Hooper showed up with two bottles of wine because he was going over to someone's house during dinner time. It's often considered good manners or simply polite to bring drinks or food to someone's place if you're a guest."

    {
      "question": "What is \"Jaws\" about?",
      "answer": "When the remains of a woman's body wash ashore on the New England island of Amity, Police Chief Martin Brody () suspects a shark attack. When Brody's suspicion is confirmed by Oceanographic Institute shark expert Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), they request that the beaches be closed down until the shark is killed. Unfortunately, it is the weekend of July 4th, and Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) doesn't want to lose the tourist money that the community will gain, so he refuses to close the beaches. When another boy is killed, however, Brody, Hooper, and local fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw) set out to kill the shark ...but they're going to need a bigger boat. Edit"

    {
      "question": "Is \"Jaws\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "Jaws is a 1974 novel by American author Peter Benchley [1940-2006]. The screenplay for Jaws was co-written by Benchley and American screenwriter Carl Gottlieb, with an uncredited assist by another American screenwriter, Howard Sackler. Benchley was inspired by several real-life incidents, such as the Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916 that resulted in four deaths over 12 days. The success of the movie inspired three movie sequelsâ€” (1978), Jaws 3-D (1983) (1983) and Jaws: The Revenge (1987) (1987). Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it based on a true story?",
      "answer": "Not directly, but it was inspired by events from 1916 in which a Great White Shark killed four people in a series of attacks along the East Coast of America. It would later be caught and killed by a pair of amateur fishermen.In the 1997 book \"In the Slick of the Cricket\" by Russell Drumm, the author makes a strong case that the character of Quint, in Peter Benchley's novel \"Jaws,\" was based on Frank Mundus, a Point Montauk charter fisherman who was the first to systematically fish for great whites, and who began the shark-hunting craze. Mundus himself (who died in 2008) was furious with Benchley for never acknowledging his influence. When filming \"Jaws,\" Robert Shaw did state that he based the character of Quint on Mundus. In addition, some of Mundus's recollections concern incidents in his career that closely resemble the Amity Island panic in \"Jaws.\""

    {
      "question": "Where is Amity Island located?",
      "answer": "The only given clue to the location of Amity Island is that it is located in New England. In the book, Amity is located on Long Island, New York. The movie itself was filmed in Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts and the boats used in the film contain the state registration abbreviation of \"MS\" which also indicates Massachusetts. (State abbreviations for watercraft are not necessarily the same as the ones used by the US Postal Service.) During the scene on the beach when Alex Kintner is attacked, a radio report giving the times of ferry runs is heard. It is somewhat difficult to hear and it helps to have captioning turned on, but the announcer mentions Martha's Vineyard along with Amity and Nantucket Island. Therefore, Amity is apparently located off the coast of Massachusetts somewhere in the vicinity of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the Mayor go to such trouble to keep the beach open?",
      "answer": "The film gives no reason other than that his greed outweighs his judgment. He tries to justify it by saying the town couldn't possibly survive financially if the summer tourist season were disrupted. As a beach community, the small businesses of Amity (restaurants, stores, boat chartering, etc.) would rely on tourist money to pay for their expenses (heating, water, food) during the off-season months (late fall, winter, early spring). If the beaches were closed until the shark was killed, none of the usual vacationers and their families would come to Amity. In the novel, the mayor owed money to some dangerous people and had to keep the beach open in order to stay alive. One could use this plot as his reasoning in the film, though it is never said."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Chief Brody say \"We're gonna need a bigger boat\"?",
      "answer": "The line \"We're gonna need a bigger boat\" is usually attributed to the moment after Chief Brody first see's the shark but in reality he says \"You're gonna need a bigger boat.\""
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the story told by Quint about the USS Indianapolis true?",
      "answer": "Yes it is, though the screenwriters have dramatized some of the details. The ship was officially called USS Indianapolis CA-35, a U.S. Navy heavy cruiser that was torpedoed and sunk in the Pacific Ocean by a Japanese submarine just after midnight on July 30, 1945. (Quint incorrectly states the date as June 29th rather than July 30th.) The loss of over 800 men made it the second worst single ship-loss disaster for the U.S. Navy during the war, behind the battleship USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor (1,177 men) and more than the heavy cruiser USS Juneau (690 men) at Guadalcanal. The story of the ship's crew struggling for five days in the waters of the Pacific Ocean before being rescued is all true. Also, the Indianapolis didn't deliver the entire atomic bomb to Tinian which was dropped on Hiroshima but rather the critical components for it, namely the uranium used. Quint's telling of the story makes it seem as though most of the sailors were eaten by sharks. In actuality, it is believed a few hundred men died in the initial attack. After the ship sank, most of the other deaths were caused by dehydration from spending five days floating in salt-water (and in many instances, from sailors being poisoned by drinking salt-water out of thirst and desperation). There were indeed numerous instances of sailors being killed by sharks, but it was nowhere near the number that Quint indicates in his story (specifically, when he says that over 1,100 men went into the water, 316 came out, and the sharks took the rest). However, a very large number of corpses were eventually eaten by sharks, and the Indianapolis incident, while often misleadingly dubbed as \"the biggest shark attack in history\" (based on the number of living sailors actually being killed by sharks) is still widely regarded as the biggest and most significant case of sharks eating human flesh."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would Quint say, \"I'll find him for $3,000...\"? Wouldn't finding the shark be easy for anyone?",
      "answer": "It seems that it should be easy to find such a large predatory animal, but remember that the ocean is a very huge body of water and that the shark would have the entirety of it in which to hide. Quint knows that such a shark would be very difficult to hunt and find in the ocean. What Quint said exactly was \"I'll *find* him for three. But I'll catch him and kill him for ten.\". What this means is that his price is $10,000. If they were to only pay him $3,000, they'd only be buying part of his service; finding the shark. The extra $7,000 would buy the catching and killing of the shark. It's more or less a negotiating tactic that worked out well for Quint because they eventually hire him. In the novel, when Benchley describes Alex Kintner being attacked, he goes into some pretty sharp detail about the shark's territory beyond the beach. There's a several hundred foot drop-off about 50 yards from the edge of the beach. This seems to be the main area where the shark lives until it attacks. That's a huge area where a shark, even as large as this one, can hide. In the film, right after his son witnesses the man being dragged under by the shark, Brody looks out at the wide open ocean, a shot that reinforces the idea that the shark will be hard to find."

    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "In the hope that he can inject a powerful poison into the shark, Hooper lowers himself in a shark-proof cage and waits underwater. Before long, the shark appears, rams the cage, and virtually destroys it. This results in Hooper dropping the injecting-device and fleeing to the seabed. Meanwhile, Brody and Quint, believing Hooper has been killed, must deal with the shark as it then begins to destroy the boat. The shark leaps out of the water and lands on the stern and the boat immediately begins to submerge. Quint slips on the wet deck, slides into the shark's great jaws, and is pulled under the water to his death. Brody, still aboard the sinking boat, throws an air tank into the shark's mouth and then manages to get onto the mast. He grabs Quint's rifle and, as the shark approaches, begins to take shots at the air tank. Just before the shark reaches him, Brody hits it and the shark is blown to pieces. The boat sinks beneath the surface and Brody happily laughs to himself. Hooper suddenly comes up from behind him. Smiling all the way, they begin together to kick their way back to the shore on two of the left over barrels from the Orca. Meanwhile, seagulls begin to flock on the shark's corpse, pecking at the remains of the once great beast."

    {
      "question": "Is it credible to have a 25-foot-long Great White Shark?",
      "answer": "The biggest Great White Shark ever confirmed caught was 21 feet long whilst the greatest ever claimed caught was 23 feet long. Various Great White Sharks have been claimed up to 36 feet long but these have never been substantiated. A 25-foot-long Great White Shark is therefore not implausible but would be an extremely rare outlier."
    },
    {
      "question": "Would an air tank really explode like that when hit by a bullet?",
      "answer": "Scientifically, no. SCUBA tanks are built and designed so that they would not explode when such pressure is applied. In a special episode of the TV show dedicated to myths of Jaws, it was confirmed that an air tank would never explode like that. It would go flying off like a rocket if hit dead center at the end. If hit off center or in the side, it would spin in circles as it flew away, either of which would still have been fatal for the shark but in a much less spectacular manner. Spielberg decided that the ending would be more uplifting if he went against the logic and made the tank explosive (the film ending is very different from the original novel, where Brody's fight against the shark is of a completely different nature). Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it plausible that the shark would be able to jump onto the boat in the final scene?",
      "answer": "Great White Sharks have been confirmed to be able to jump up to 8ft in the air to pursue their prey so it is not unreasonable to expect them to be able to breach Quint's boat."
    },
    {
      "question": "Any recommendations for other movies about shark attacks?",
      "answer": "Jaws is considered to be the benchmark shark-attack movie but, following Jaws, there have been a number of similar movies. This is more of a list of titles rather than recommendations but you may wish to take a look at , Cyclone (1978), L'ultimo squalo (1981) (The Last Shark), and Deep Blue Sea (1999). There is the Shark Attack franchise featuring Shark Attack (1999), Shark Attack 2 (2000), and Shark Attack 3: Megalodon (2002). As well, there are Open Water (2003), The Reef (2010), Sharktopus (2010), Shark Night 3D (2011), Sand Sharks (2012), 2-Headed Shark Attack (2012), Sharknado (2013), Ghost Shark (2013), The Shallows (2016), 47 Meters Down (2017), and 47 Meters Down: Uncaged (2019).

      "question": "What does the man in the red rowboat mean when he says to Michael and his friends \"Haul in the sheet and make it fast\"?",
      "answer": "'Sheet' is the nautical term for the ropes used to control a sailboat. Each sheet has its own name as well, e.g., the halyard is the sheet that raises the sail. Basically, he was telling them to hurry up with their knot."

      "question": "Why does Quint destroy the boat radio?",
      "answer": "While there is no official explanation for Quint smashing the boat radio, fans have come up with two possible explanations.A. He wants Brody and Hooper to keep their eyes on the prize, so to speak. If they truly can't be helped by those on-shore, all that can be done is to kill the shark themselves.B. Quint, in a prideful fashion, wants to keep the glory and money from killing the shark all to himself or, at the very least, wants as few people as possible to share in the glory/money. The last thing he'd want in that case is for Brody to call in for help."

    {
      "question": "After Quint sabotages the marine CB radio while Brody is calling for an SOS, it's obvious Quint is out of his mind, especially with the engines being damaged and barely operational, why doesn't police chief Brody take control along with Hooper's help, arrest Quint and put him in handcuffs in order to save all of their lives?",
      "answer": "Quint WAS out of his mind, he was behaving recklessly without any regard for chief Brody, Hooper or his own life along with the safety of the Orca that which was taking on water and had extreme engine damage. Look closely, Brody DID bring his handcuffs, they are clearly on his duty belt across his back when he, Quint and Hopper are on the flybridge of the Orca as Quint is racing the Orca to shallow water to drown the shark. The engine and boat were severely damaged and they knew it, this made their situation much more dangerous for being stranded when/if the engine blew up, thanks to Quint's criminal negligence. Once Brody and Hooper realized they were over their heads in trying to kill the shark, all Brody and Hooper wanted was to get back to land, killing the shark was not even a consideration anymore and became meaningless to staying alive..."

    },
    {
      "question": "Why couldn't Hooper poison the shark from the boat instead of going under water in the shark cage?",
      "answer": "The poison (strychnine nitrate) was in the needle and the sharks hide was too tough for the needle to penetrate as Hooper mentions to Quint who says \"You can get this little needle through his skin?\" to which Hooper responds that he can't, Hooper had to go in the water so that he could get the needle into the shark's mouth, where the flesh was less tough."
