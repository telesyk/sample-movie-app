      "question": "When does the story take place ?",
      "answer": "It takes place in the Muromachi Era (1392-1573, or 1333-1467, depending on the scholar), around the time of the War of Onin (1467-1477). Miyazaki chose this era since the relationship between the Japanese and nature changed greatly around that time. During the Muromachi Era, iron production jumped, which required great numbers of trees to be cut down (for charcoal), and people came to feel that they could control nature. Also, it was the time before Japan as we know it was formed. It was a confusing, yet lively era. Women had more freedom, and a lot of new arts were born. The rigid class structure of Samurai, farmers, and artisans was yet to be established. Miyazaki sees similarities between the Muromachi era and the current era, which is going through various changes and confusion."

      "question": "What is Kodama, the white little creature?",
      "answer": "Kodama means \"echo\" (its literal meaning is a \"tree spirit\"). However, since its name is written in Katakana, not in Kanji, it could also mean \"small ball\" or \"small spirit\". They (there are many, in various sizes and shapes) are a kind of spirit who live in the forest. Although Kodama (a tree spirit) appears in many Japanese folktales, Kodama as a little white creature is Miyazaki's creation."

    {
      "question": "What does Mononoke Hime mean?",
      "answer": "『姫』 \"Hime\" means \"Princess\" in Japanese. Ghibli has given \"Mononoke Hime\" the English title \"Princess Mononoke\". Mononoke Hime (or Princess Mononoke) is what San, the heroine, is called by other people, since she was raised by a mononoke and looks and acts like a mononoke. In times, when medical knowledge had not been fully developed, mononoke were believed to be spirits that were said to do things like possess individuals and make them suffer, cause disease, or even cause death."
