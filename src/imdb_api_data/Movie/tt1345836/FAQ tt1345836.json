      "question": "Who created the character of Batman? Bob Kane is listed in old (pre-2015) media including the comic books as creating Batman on his own but new media (made after 2015) shows him as co-creating the character with someone called Bill Finger, so what's all that about?",
      "answer": "It's a long story so here goes....After the success of the comic book Superhero Superman, artist tried to come up with his own hero \"The Bat-Man\", the character Kane created wore a red suit with a domino mask, blonde hair and a pair of bat wings. Kane then asked for writer Bill Finger's assistance on the project. Finger rejected several of Kane's initial ideas about the character and suggested several changes in design and characterization. His changes included changing his hair colour, a black colour scheme for the costume, adding a cape and cowl, the idea that he shouldn't have any superpowers, his civilian identity of Bruce Wayne (which Finger named after Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland and general Anthony \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne), the origin story about his parents being shot in an alley and the idea that he should also be a detective.Kane marketed the \"Batman\" character to National Comics, and Batman's first story was published in \"Detective Comics\" #27 (May 1939). The script was written by an uncredited Finger, making him the first of many ghost writers to work on comics officially credited to Bob Kane. When Kane negotiated a contract about selling the rights to the \"Batman\" character, he claimed he was the sole creator and demanded a sole mandatory byline acknowledging him as such on all comics and adaptations. Out of fairness, Kane agreed to pay Finger his share with money out of his earnings. Unfortunately, the agreement was never put into writing, and Finger never saw a cent.Finger would go on to ghost write Batman stories up into the mid 1960's, either with Kane or for DC Comics directly. During his writing tenure, Finger was responsible for the unaccredited creation of many key players and pieces in the Batman universe.These included the Batmobile, the Batcave, Gotham City, and Batman's nickname \"The Dark Knight\". He also came up with several secondary Batman characters including, his sidekick Robin, his arch-nemesis The Joker, and his occasional love interest Catwoman, as well as Commissioner Gordon, The Riddler and The Scarecrow. Despite all of this, the only writing credit that Finger received for Batman in his lifetime were two episodes of Batman (1966), The Clock King's Crazy Crimes (1966) and The Clock King Gets Crowned (1966) which he co-wrote with friend Charles Sinclair.Eventually, the truth did come out. Finger attended the first official New York Comic Con in 1965 and sat on a panel with other comic book creators where he revealed the role he played in Batman's creation. Finger's story gained exposure in a two-page article titled \"If the truth be known, or a Finger in every plot!,\" written and distributed by pop culturist Jerry Bails. Kane caught wind of Finger's appearance not long after and replied in the form of a printed letter to Batman fan magazine, \"Batmania,\" where he labeled his old friend a fraud. Finger, who by this time was deeply in debt, continued to write for various projects in and outside of comic books until his death in 1974, when he was found alone in his apartment by friend Charles Sinclair. Finger died penniless and his contributions to the character was never acknowledged in his lifetime.However, after the popularity of Tim Burton's Batman (1989), Kane acknowledged Finger as \"a contributing force\" in the character's creation, and wrote in his 1989 autobiography \"Batman and Me\" that \"Now that my long-time friend and collaborator is gone, I must admit that Bill never received the fame and recognition he deserved. He was an unsung hero ... I often tell my wife, if I could go back fifteen years, before he died, I would like to say. 'I'll put your name on it now. You deserve it.'\"Many failed attempts were made over the years by Finger's family to get him recognition for his work, including a request from his second wife Lyn Simmons to have his name listed in the credits of Tim Burton's Batman (1989).Finger remained largely unknown, even to Batman fans, until writer Marc Tyler Nobleman began investigating the late author's life for a book being written about him called \"Bill the Boy Wonder: The Secret Co-Creator of Batman\". Nobleman went in search of Finger's family to help fill in the gaps and give him credit. While Finger's autopsy report claimed no relatives were present, Nobleman discovered that Finger had a son, Fred.Unfortunately, Fred, who was an outspoken proponent of his father, had died in 1992. Nobleman learned that Fred was also homosexual, leading him to believe that Fred had no children before his death. The trail was starting to go cold.However, after receiving new information from Finger's nephew, Nobleman discovered Fred indeed had a daughter, Athena Finger, who was born two years after Finger's death. Nobleman met with Athena and convinced her to meet with DC about getting recognition for her grandfather. DC in turn welcomed Athena with open arms, cut her a check and invited her to the premiere of The Dark Knight (2008) with all expenses paid. It wasn't until around 2012 that DC offered her more money. This time, however, she had to sign away her rights to her grandfather's claim. With encouragement from Nobleman, Athena rejected the money and took DC to court.It took years of litigation before a settlement was reached. A major turning point in the case was the unearthing of recorded interviews with Bob Kane during the writing of his autobiography. During one of the interviews, Tom Andrae, Kane's co-writer, asked Kane to what extent Finger contributed to Batman's creation. \"Bill was responsible for 50 to 75 percent,\" Kane bluntly responded.Finally, in September 2015, DC Entertainment issued a statement informing the public that Finger would be listed as co-creator on any piece of Batman media henceforth. Starting with the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and the second season of Gotham (2014), an updated acknowledgement for the character appeared as \"Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger\".Finger's story was later used as the subject of the Hulu original documentary, Batman & Bill (2017).

      "question": "Would the Joker have been the main villain if Heath Ledger hadn't died?",
      "answer": "There is no way to know, but it's unlikely that the Joker would have been the main villain. After Christopher Nolan finished filming The Dark Knight (2008) he had absolutely no plans to make a sequel and it wasn't until after he had finished Inception (2010) that he decided to make The Dark Knight Rises (2012). By that point Ledger had been dead for 2 years. However given the structure of the Trilogy it is highly doubtful that the Joker would have been the main villain. The Dark Knight (2008) did not use any of the villains from Batman Begins (2005) as the main focus (The Scarecrow was only in one scene while Falcone and Ra's al Ghul did not appear), instead it stood on its own and focused on The Joker and Two-Face. Furthermore The Dark Knight Rises (2012) stood on its own as well as it focused on Bane and the villains from the previous films only appeared in cameo appearances or recycled footage from previous films. Having said that even though this is speculation it is possible that the Joker would have been mentioned had Ledger not died or even possibly appeared in a flashback or cameo but it's unlikely he would have been one of the main characters."

      "question": "How does the television set work in Bane's prison, and why did Bruce break it with the rock?",
      "answer": "Bane wanted it installed there for when he eventually had Bruce placed down there, the latter would be forced to watch and listen as his city rots under Bane's tenure. When Bruce escapes The Pit, we're shown a town that's nearby, which is where a signal could've been picked up.Bruce witnessing the slaying of the special forces agents only added to his anger more when trying to escape The Pit in enough time. It was the last straw of having to watch his city being tortured and innocent people dying, and he saw through Bane's bluff of detonating the bomb if the outside world interfered- so he felt that he had no reason to listen to it anymore."

    {
      "question": "Why didn't the other prisoners try to escape The Pit without the rope, or could they have just climbed up the rope? Could Bruce had added a few extra steps to his jump?",
      "answer": "Several of the prisoners are older and more frail, and it's implied that the others are too afraid to climb The Pit without the rope due to fear of falling off and getting killed (Bruce was shown falling on his second attempt due to a loose brick). Bruce makes his attempt to escape The Pit with no rope as a last resort.The rope is attached to a certain point in the wall that allows a prisoner to get on top of the pillar that leads to their freedom, if a person were to climb it they'd have to make a huge jump to the very top which opens up the risk of getting killed. Bruce could've added a few extra steps to his jump, but that doesn't quite guarantee that he'd make it. Aside from that, him taking a single leap is meant to fit with the symbolism of him making the leap of faith and finally learning to embrace his fear which renews his strength."

      "question": "How was Alfred able to access information about Bane for Bruce Wayne?",
      "answer": "Alfred used Bruce Wayne's computer to do a background check on him. Bane would've been known in Gotham before due to him being behind a coup in West Africa that secured mining operations for John Daggett. Alfred was able to read further into the rumors surrounding him, his involvement with The League of Shadows; which would obviously come from reports since he was a wanted terrorist and The League of Shadows have been an existing cause for centuries."

      "question": "Which characters were adapted from the Batman comic books?",
      "answer": "Note: For this list only the creators of the characters first appearances are listed. As with all comic book characters, Batman and his supporting cast have had several reinventions and different contributions from different writers. Theses include different iterations in different mediums that all have added different concepts to the overall mythology of the characters.Obviously there's Bruce Thomas Wayne/Batman called only Bruce Wayne or Batman on screen. He made his first appearance in the comic story \"The Case of the Chemical Syndicate\" from Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) by writer and artist Bob Kane.Alfred, the butler, whose full name in the comics is Alfred Thaddeus Crane Pennyworth. In his first comic appearances he was called Alfred Beagle and first appeared in the comic story \"Here Comes Alfred\" from Batman #16 (April-May 1943) by writer Don Cameron and artist Bob Kane. The characters were later reintroduced as Alfred Pennyworth (complete with a different appearance) in comics continuity by writer Bill Finger and artist Jerry Robinson.Gotham City Police Commissioner, James Worthington Gordon, Sr., called Commissioner Gordon or Jim on screen. Just like Batman, he made his first appearance in the comic story \"The Case of the Chemical Syndicate\" from Detective Comics #27 (May 1939) by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane.Lucius Fox, who made his first appearance in the comic story \"Dark Messenger of Mercy\" from Batman #307 (January 1979) and was created by writer Len Wein and artist John Calnan.Bane, who made his first appearance in the comic story Batman: Vengeance of Bane #1 (January 1993) by writers Chuck Dixon & Doug Moench and artist Graham Nolan, from a concept by Denny O'Neil.Selina Kyle/Catwoman, called Selina or Miss Kyle on screen. In her first comic appearance, she was called \"The Cat\" and appeared in a story of the same name in Batman #1 (Spring 1940) by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane.Talia al Ghul, who is Ra's al Ghul's daughter. In this film she goes by the alias Miranda Tate. She made her first appearance in the comic story \"Into the Den of the Death-Dealers!\" from Detective Comics #411 (May 1971) by writer Denny O'Neil and artist Bob Brown from a concept by then DC comics \"Batman\" editor Dick Giordano.Ra's al Ghul, who appears in flashbacks. He made his first appearance in \"Daughter of the Demon\" from Batman #232 (June 1971) by writer Denny O'Neil, and artist Neal Adams from a concept by then DC Comics \"Batman\" editor Julius Schwartz who also came up with the name.and Dr Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow, who made his first appearance in the comic story \"Riddle of the Human Scarecrow\" from World's Finest Comics #3 (Fall 1941) by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane.All other characters were created just for the film by the film's writers.

      "question": "Is \"The Dark Knight Rises\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "The Dark Knight Rises is the third and final film in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, preceded by (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008) (2008). It was filmed from a screenplay co-written by Nolan and his brother Jonathan and a story by Nolan and American screenwriter David S. Goyer. The screenplay, though, had at least one book as an influence-Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens. Other influences include the Batman graphic novels- The Dark Knight Returns, Knightfall and No Man's Land.The character of Bane was taken from the comic book series. In the DC Comics literary universe, Bane made his debut in Batman: Vengeance of Bane #1 (January 1993). The scene where Bane breaks Batman's back first appeared in Batman #497 (July 1993). Similar to the novel Batman: Legacy, Bane in this film succeeds Ra's al Ghul in their plan to destroy Gotham City. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the movie based on \"A Tale of Two Cities\"?",
      "answer": "This film is inspired heavily by the novel, featuring an uprising as a major part of their narrative, with other similarities including use of character names such as Stryver and Barsad. Gordon's passage that he reads for Bruce's funeral is quoted from the book, and Bruce's journey to some degree mirrors that of Charles Darnay and Sydney Carton. The main antagonists, Bane and Talia al Ghul and their relationship mirrors that of Monsieur and Madame Defarge. There are other hints to Dickens' novel, such as Talia al Ghul being obsessed with revenge and having a close relationship to the hero, and Bane's catchphrase \"the fire rises\" as an ode to one of the book's chapters.The Dark Knight Rises is different enough though to stand on its own; as it should be understood that Dickens' novel deals with one of the most important events in history, the French Revolution. Bane's revolution is fake, being only supported by a small proportion of Gotham's populace and the freed prisoners of Blackgate; the rest appear to go into hiding, including the deputy police commissioner, Foley."

      "question": "Should the other Batman movies be watched to understand this one?",
      "answer": "Someone who watches The Dark Knight Rises first should be able to follow the overall story. However, there are many story references to the first two films. Important story elements like why Batman is in seclusion, who Harvey Dent was and what he did, and who Ra's Al Ghul and the League of Shadows are, will not be understood by someone who has not seen the two movies before this one."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Bruce Wayne retire as Batman before the events of the film?",
      "answer": "He retired because he wasn't needed anymore after taking the fall for Harvey Dent. He told Gordon in the hospital dialogue, \"The Batman wasn't needed anymore. We won.\" This is because the goal of Batman was to be a symbol that inspired people to fight Gotham's criminal and corrupt, as stated in Batman Begins. Since most of the cops were corrupt, Batman had to do this by vigilante means. Batman did this by waging war on organized crime—the root of the criminal and corrupt.By the time of the events of The Dark Knight, he inspired both the copycat vigilantes and Harvey Dent to fight the criminal and corrupt. Bruce preferred the latter over the former as he told Alfred, \"[the vigilantes] weren't what I had in mind when I wanted to inspire people\". Bruce believes that Harvey was \"the first legitimate ray of light in decades\" and \"the symbol of hope [Batman] could never be\"; since Harvey was using legal means to fight the criminal and corrupt; and his prosecution managed to \"lock up half of the cities criminals [without wearing a mask]\", as Bruce prefaced it.Since already 549 of the 1,000 criminals were now locked up—allowing what Dent called \"18 months of clean streets\" for the 549 criminals that comprised the whole mob (Lau, the mob's last money launder, when talking to the mobs, said, \"everyone's money would be at stake\", for the mob laundered all their money to him, but he surrendered all his clients to Dent)—Batman was soon not needed as the police could easily handle the remaining street criminals.Also, The Dark Knight further explains the temporary nature of Batman: Natasha in the dinner scene mentions to Harvey Dent, \"Gotham needs heroes like you—elected officials—not a man who thinks he is above the law.\" Bruce then agrees by saying, \"Exactly. Who appointed the Batman?\" But then Harvey, believing in vigilantism, answers, \"We did—all of us who stood by and led scum take control of our city.\" But Natasha says, \"But this is a democracy, Harvey.\" Harvey then says,When their enemies were at the gates, the Romans would suspend democracy and appoint one man to protect the city. It was not considered an honor, it was considered a public service.So, when an enemy, like organized crime or a terrorist, is attacking Gotham, there must be a suspension of democracy since only a vigilante like Batman can effectively beat it. But, Rachel rebuts, \"Harvey, the last man to be appointed to protect the republic was named Caesar, and he never gave up his power.\" So, after Batman defeats organized crime, he must give up his power or else he will be corrupt. Harvey then agrees with this and says, \"Okay, fine. You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\" And since Batman indirectly defeated organized crime by having Harvey's prosecution lock up the whole mob, Bruce then honors what Harvey said by telling Rachel in the Penthouse party that he was going to retire soon.But then the mob leaders used bail to get out of jail and hire Joker, who then caused Harvey to go on a killing spree. According to Gordon, because of Dent's murdering spree, \"Harvey's prosecutions, everything he fought for...undone.\" The mayor warned Harvey that in 18 months of jail, the mob would try to use any dirt on Harvey to undo his prosecution during the appeal process. Thus, if the \"criminals can get anything on [Harvey], they would be back on the streets.\" Batman reiterated the same thing to Dent after he caught him interrogating the insane man in the dark alley. Plus, according to Joker, if the people of Gotham find out about his murdering spree, they would \"[lose] their minds\". That would probably create freaks like the Joker. So, Batman had to sacrifice his reputation to keep the prosecution and to keep Gotham's sanity. Since no one knew of Harvey's crimes, the mob would fail at appeal and not leave jail. With the whole mob in jail, half the mob's money burned, mob bosses dead—leaving the mobsters vulnerable and eliminating financial incentives for police corruption—and the Joker captured, the remaining criminals on the streets would have trouble rebuilding the organized crime machine and would be arrested if they tried so. And with the Dent Act eliminating parole, the mob is locked up for good along with any additional criminals later arrested, thus deterring organized crime from bouncing back.In conclusion, by inspiring Dent, the whole mob was jailed under his prosecution, then jailed for good—eliminating organized crime—under the Dent Act. Thus, Batman was no longer needed and Bruce could retire. Some viewers might note that The Dark Knight suggested Batman couldn't retire since Joker told Batman in their last encounter, \"I think you and I are destined to [fight each other] forever.\" However, Batman rebutted him by saying \"You'll be locked up in a padded cell forever.\" Joker then said, \"Maybe we could share one.\" Thus, this suggests Joker would be locked up forever since he admitted to it. Also, some viewers might think Gordon saying \"we will hunt him because he can take it\" means Batman can't retire. Yet, in the The Dark Knight Rises hospital scene, Gordon seemed confused that Batman retired since he said, \"We were in this together... then you were gone\". He apparently misunderstood or forgot what Batman told him years ago, \"You'll hunt me [...] because that's what needs to happen\". Batman meant for Gordon to pursue him that night and thereafter so that the Batman could and would be viewed as a criminal not a crime fighter. Otherwise, Batman helping capture any remaining criminals would bring suspicion to the public and cops that Gordon framed Batman, would cause chase scenes on him allowing criminals to escape (like what happened with the stock heist chase), and would undermine Dent's martyring that inspired the public and cops to change for the better to fix the city."

      "question": "What exactly happened to Bruce Wayne in the eight years between films? Did Bruce and Batman disappear the same night?",
      "answer": "Bruce was active as a philanthropist and investor for five years, and became a recluse for three years. Bruce Wayne tried to move on by becoming a billionaire philanthropist, using the Wayne Foundation to fund Dent Day and charities like Saint Swithen's orphanage along with, according to Lucius in the office scene, funneling the entire Wayne Enterprises R and D budget for five years into a fusion energy project. The project resulted in the creation of a brand new, unique fusion reactor which was labeled as the first real hope for humanity to have a sustainable source of energy.But Bruce mothballed the reactor three years before *The Dark Knight Rises*; according to Miranda in the reactor scene,* \"Three years ago a Russian scientist published a paper on weaponized fusion reactions.\" *Upon learning this, Bruce feared that someone could turn the reactor into a bomb and effectively destroy Gotham with it. So, Miranda said, \"One week later (Bruce claimed that the) reactor started developing problems..\" Miranda told Bruce at the charity ball that he spent half his fortune on a plan to save the world with the fusion reactor \"and isn't so wounded when it fails that he goes into hiding..\"Thus, after Bruce gave up on the project, Bruce felt that he had nothing else left in the world and locked himself away in Wayne Manor, becoming a recluse, waiting for things to go bad in Gotham in the hopes of once again becoming Batman and having a purpose in life, or as Alfred suggests, a reason to die."

      "question": "Why did the CIA not check the identity of the three men before bringing them on the plane?",
      "answer": "The CIA agent and his team didn't check because they didn't know Barsad, the driver who turned the hooded men in, was working for Bane. Barsad is shown to be Bane's right hand man throughout the movie. The fact that Barsad speaks with an Uzbekistani accent in this scene and an English one throughout the rest of the movie indicates that he was using a false identity to deceive the CIA agent and his team.It appears that Bane had Barsad work with the CIA, since Barsad told the CIA man when he asked why he brought the kidnapped men; Barsad said, \"Don't worry, no charge for (the kidnapped men)\" and \"(Bane's men) were trying to claim your prize\". So, the CIA already trusted Barsad-assuming the CIA must trust someone before hiring them."

      "question": "How old is Bruce Wayne/Batman supposed to be in this film? How long was Bruce serving as Batman?",
      "answer": "The climax of Batman Begins occurs on the eve of Bruce Wayne's 30th birthday. The Dark Knight takes place approximately six to nine months later, and The Dark Knight Rises takes place eight years after The Dark Knight. Five months pass within The Dark Knight Rises (eleven if you count the prologue taking place six months before the remainder of the film). Therefore Bruce is 38 and likely turns 39 at some point. Bruce was Batman for one year before The Dark Knight, since the Joker in that film said, \"Let's wind the clocks back a year\", to the mobsters when he was referring to how, a year ago, Batman wasn't there and Gotham City's legal system was still entirely in the mobs' hands."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Bruce Wayne in such terrible physical shape at the beginning of the film?",
      "answer": "Being Batman is a physically demanding job, Bruce Wayne had been shot, stabbed, beaten, set on fire, gassed by weaponized hallucinogens, fallen from extreme heights, bitten by dogs, survived explosions, crashes, etc. While the Batsuit would offer him some protection, the physical trauma he had sustained would certainly take its toll on his body. As we see at the beginning of The Dark Knight, Bruce had several scars over his body and he had only been Batman for a year. In this film, eight years have passed and Bruce has been in seclusion for three years before the events of The Dark Knight Rises. If he didn't stay in top shape, the previous injuries to his body would likely start taking their toll. i.e. not exercising joints can worsen arthritis; since he damaged much of his cartilage in his left knee from falling at the end of The Dark Knight and wasn't physically active for the last three years, the pain grew and caused him to use a cane."

The setting is identical to a scene featured in The Dark Knight but in a different camera view and with different lines. It is not known if the setting was recreated for the new movie in order to seem identical or if it is unused footage from the previous movie.

A holiday was declared in his honor, \"Harvey Dent Day\", which has been celebrated for up to eight years. The cover-up of Dent's crimes also plays a part in Bane's scheme to take over Gotham. In addition, the Gotham government also implements the \"Dent Act\" ad memoriam to the District Attorney's legacy, which denied all prisoners incarcerated in Blackgate Penitentiary access to parole. Bane completely destroys Harvey Dent's legacy by revealing the truth of Dent's crimes to the city. During Bane's speech, he tears up a picture of Harvey Dent and reads a written statement regarding Dent and the GCPD by Commissioner Gordon. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the \"Dent Act\" mentioned in the movie?",
      "answer": "The Dent Act is a law honoring the late Harvey Dent for his commitment to rid Gotham of organized crime. The act is implied to have many anti-organized crime measures, since the mayor said it gave police the \"teeth\" it needed against the mob. But, John Blake tells us it's most important aspect: there is absolutely no possibility of parole: \"These men, locked up in Blackgate for eight years, denied parole under the Dent Act. . .\" Gordon tells Blake that rules like parole \"aren't weapons anymore, they're shackles, letting the bad get ahead\".Without parole, the criminals are forced to serve their full sentence (i.e. 20 years under a RICO case) instead of taking advantage of parole and going on a crime spree again. This part of the act probably came from the fact that the mob leaders in the previous film used the similar method of bail to get out of jail and use the Joker to cause chaos in Gotham. The act eliminated organized crime and corruption by denying parole so criminals are locked up for good-discouraging any further organized crime; this was made easier, since Dent's prosecution already cleaned the streets. Blake reminds the audience of this by saying to Gordon, \"When you and Dent cleaned the streets you cleaned 'em good.\"The mob laundered all their money to Lau since he said Dent \"put all of (his) competitors out of business\" and that the police \"identified the mob's banks. . and were planning to cease (the mob's) funds\"; so, he said \"everyone's money is at stake\" if the police leverages one of them. Lau was leveraged and gave Gordon all his clients-the mobsters-and Dent used RICO to prosecute all 549 of them; Dent got away with locking up 549 of the 1,000 criminals in Gotham since the mayor said, \"the public likes you. . . that's the only reason this might fly\".Locking up all of Gotham's mobsters caused irreparable damage to the organized crime machine so the police can easily handle the remaining street criminals; thus why Dent told the mayor he will have \"18 months of clean streets\". And the reason why he said 18 months is since after that time, the mayor said the mob would \"kick (his) ass with appeals\" and will try to win them by \"get(ting) anything on (Dent)\" so \"(these) criminals would be back on the streets\".Since Batman hid Harvey's crimes, the mob failed at appeal and are stuck in jail and got denied parole. With half of the mob's money burned, the mob left leaderless from Joker's arrest and the three mob leaders dead - destroying links between corrupt law enforcement and Maroni -and the mobsters already locked up, the remaining street criminals would have difficulty trying to rebuild and commit organized crime and be arrested if they try so. Since Gordon stated, \"there are a thousand inmates in Blackgate Prison. . . violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized crime machine\", that means the remaining 500 criminals tried to reinvigorate organized crime but got arrested, jailed, and denied parole."

So, a Gothamite taking economic advantage of a nation that was attacked by an infamous terrorist would be controversial to Gothamites like Gordon who always is looking out for bad things among Gotham even in what a congressman in the Dent Day ceremony called \"peacetime\"; Blake, when he was with Gordon on police headquarter's rooftop, said Gordon's mentality is like \"we're still at war\" even after he cleaned the streets 8 years ago.

      "question": "How did Bane and his men get the motorcycles into the Stock Exchange building?",
      "answer": "We don't see Bane enter the building, but when he approaches the metal detector, he is still wearing his motorcycle helmet and a jacket of a delivery company. We can assume that Bane was posing as a delivery man and usually delivery orders come through the back entrance of a building. Thus, the motorcycles were from the back entrance of the building. Then, after Bane took the exchange hostage, his men could have easily taken the bikes in before the police arrived.Even if that didn't happen, considering his men worked as the maintenance and operators of the exchange, they could have previously sneaked the bikes in when the building was closed."

      "question": "Why did it go day to night suddenly in the motorcycle chase?",
      "answer": "The day to night shift seems to be a continuity error. If the audience watches closely though; we see the outside lights are lit outside the stock exchange as the police arrive, and the sky in each scene gets darker as it cuts to each other, before they enter the tunnels-thus we can assume the motorcycle chase was longer than shown and a lot of time would've transpired during the distance traveled."

    {
      "question": "What was the gun-like device Batman was using during the chase scene in the streets? Why did the lights in the tunnel shut down?",
      "answer": "The rifle was presumably an EMP blaster that he aimed at the motorcycle to prevent it from getting away. EMP weapons can send out a large burst of electrical energy, overwhelming targeted electronic devices; generally, simpler circuits like lights will be temporarily disabled, while more complicated circuits will be fried and completely disabled. The EMP blaster is shown to have completely disabled two motorcycles. Batman also used some EMP device in his belt to temporarily disable the lights in the tunnel and later in Bane's lair. Bruce Wayne uses EMP also when he completely disabled the paparazzi cameras when he arrived at the ball, and when he gave Gordon the Bat's EMP cannon mount to block and completely disable the trigger's connection device to the bomb later in the film."

      "question": "How does Bane differ from the \"Batman & Robin\" film and the comics?",
      "answer": "Batman & Robin portrayed Bane very differently than other versions of Batman. In it, he was reduced to being a mindless henchman. In the comics, Bane is of Caribbean descent and uses a drug called \"venom\" to create his massive hulking size. The mask he wears feeds the venom directly into his brain. Bane is a highly intelligent, mostly self-educated, cunning strategist and a skilled fighter. In The Dark Knight Rises, Bane is very similar to his comic book counterpart. One key difference is that he does not use venom. His mask holds an anesthetic to keep chronic pain at bay, which was caused by severe spinal and facial trauma. Also, Bane, while still very muscular and formidable, is a much more realistic size: His height is only about 6'2\" (1.88 m) and he weighs approximately 240 pounds (110 kilograms). Most notably different is Bane's accent; , who plays Bane, says, The choice of the accent is actually a man called Bartley Gorman, who was a bare knuckle fighter, a Romani gypsy, which I wanted to underpin the Latin-but a Romani Latin opposed to Latino. His particular accent is very specific, which was a gypsy accent. So that's why it was difficult to understand. But once you tune into it, you get it, I hope. Edit"

      "question": "How does Bane eat or drink?",
      "answer": "It was not explained in the film, but there are a few possibilities:1. He may have some sort of mechanism that allows him to suck in liquefied nutrients through his mask.2. He simply removes the mask while eating, and endures the pain.3. He may also inject himself with painkillers before taking off the mask. There may also be a nose piece on the mask or a separate one that he can detach and connect to the mask so he can still breathe in the anesthetic through his nose while leaving his mouth free to eat and drink.4. Bane might also have developed a technique or had been instructed in one that would allow him to temporarily wean himself off the pain medication before removing the mask, say, by lowering the dosage in the minutes before he would remove it, so he could take care of daily habits like shaving or eating.5. There might also be control settings on the mask that allowed him to do this as well. Some viewers believe that Bane felt a sudden shock of pain after Batman damages his mask, while others interpreted Bane's reaction more akin to panic of trying to fix the mask before the pain set in and would incapacitate him, at least temporarily, thus losing his edge in the fight. A few seconds after Batman damages the mask, Bane is able to throw Batman against a column and deliver a few more blows. Two of them don't connect and he punches the column, perhaps reinforcing the idea that the pain hadn't set in yet and begun to cripple him."

    {
      "question": "How old is Bane supposed to be?",
      "answer": "The flashbacks set in the Pit are roughly 20 years before the events of Batman Begins, and it is assumed that Bane was in his late teens to early twenties. This would put Bane somewhere roughly between 40 and 50 (counting the approximate nine months between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, as well as the eight years in between The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises) during the events of this film, although this is speculation because we are never told the ages of other parties involved."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was the gas mask that was attached to Bane feeding him \"venom\" or simply a breathing apparatus?",
      "answer": "Technically neither. In the film, the prisoner who looks after Bruce tells how the blind prisoner in the next cell was once the prison's doctor, but also a morphine addict. Bane was attacked and severely wounded. (And because of his spinal scar and back brace that we see in the scene where Gordon is brought to Bane, we know Bane's spine was severely injured and he had cervical fusion surgery) The doctor did what he could to save Bane, but with his addiction he botched the surgery, leaving Bane in constant chronic pain. The mask Bane wears \"keeps the pain at bay,\" as Bruce's prison caretaker says, so it holds an anesthetic (probably morphine) likely stored on his back brace or in his flak vest. The mask may also hold small compartments in the back of the mask in case he needs to remove the vest. There is no mention of \"venom\" in the film, though the anesthetic could be nicknamed thus. Bane simply keeps himself in excellent shape. There is an interesting article where actual medical professionals are consulted and asked how Bane's mask may work in the real world: here."

      "question": "How did Bane and Talia learn Batman's true identity, and did the original League survive?",
      "answer": "Bane was part of the League of Shadows- the same organization Bruce was part of- and so if Bane and Talia took over the League of Shadows after Ra's al Ghul's death, they would have learned this from existing members. In the sewer fight, Bane knows that Bruce betrayed the League; he wouldn't know this unless the League members informed him. Plus, in the judicial hall scene, Talia mentioned Bruce \"murdered\" her father; so that means the League members that were with Ra's in their previous Gotham attack survived, escaped and informed her. We neither see nor hear dialogue about the League after Ra's death in the first film, Batman Begins; that is because the League members escaped and survived. This is confirmed with Alfred asking Bruce, \"Who leads them now?\", in their conversation about the League in this third film, The Dark Knight Rises. And the League consists of mercenary members originally too since in Batman Begins, when Bruce first enters the temple, we see some League members holding assault weapons and wearing colored scarfs. Likewise, we see similarly dressed and armed League members descending the pit in the flashback scene in The Dark Knight Rises."

      "question": "In which US state is Gotham City located?",
      "answer": "It has never been stated directly in this trilogy, but all of the license plates say \"Gotham\" on them, so it would stand to reason that it is located in the state of Gotham, because license plates have the name of the state and not the city on them. However, in the first two movies, which were filmed in Chicago, the plates had Illinois-style designs just in case Illinois plates slipped through in the background."

      "question": "What was the purpose of the plane scene and the blood transfusion?",
      "answer": "Bane fakes Pavel's death so he can later secretly use him to turn the fusion reactor into a bomb. Dr. Pavel was in talks with both Bane's men and the CIA before the events of the movie, since Bane said on the plane, \"Dr. Pavel refused our offer in favor of (the CIA's)\". Thus, Bane had to find out what Dr. Pavel told the CIA interrogator. Bane had Barsad, shown to be Bane's right hand man throughout the movie, bring him and two others along with Dr. Pavel to the CIA.The driver, Barsad, was working with the CIA since when the CIA interrogator asked why he brought the kidnapped men, Barsad said, \"Don't worry, no charge for (the kidnapped men)\" and that \"(Bane's men) were trying to claim your prize\". This prize is assumed to be Dr. Pavel, since the CIA is trying to save him from Bane. After killing the CIA on board, Bane transfused Dr. Pavel's blood into the lookalike corpse (that is pale, has minimal hair and without blood or teeth beforehand) to do this. That way, when the plane crashes the corpse would be heavily disfigured and have Dr. Pavel's blood. This worked as in a later scene, Miranda Tate told Bruce that the \"Russian scientist died in a plane crash six months ago\".Bane let one of his men stay behind, since \"(The CIA) expects one of us in the wreckage.\" That way, when the plane crashes, the CIA would assume something went awry with the men that the CIA brought the plane, giving Bane the chance to attack the plane from the outside which killed all the agents, one Bane's men, and Dr. Pavel. The CIA would not know Bane was on the plane, since he had the agents killed after revealing himself."

      "question": "When Bruce is in his Batsuit, why does he talk in his \"Batman Voice\" when talking to himself or people who know his identity?",
      "answer": "When Bruce Wayne is in the Batsuit, he takes on the persona of Batman, so the gravelly, intimidating voice he uses can best be described as part of the outfit. Always keeping his voice altered while in the suit makes it harder for him to slip up and talk in his normal voice to the wrong person.It's worth noting that he speaks in his voice to people who know who he is twice in *The Dark Knight*; briefly to Rachel Dawes after he saves her as they're nearby bystanders and a cab driver so he couldn't let his real voice slip there, and when he speaks to Lucius Fox in the sonar room- which makes sense in order to not let anyone who's potentially watching hear who he is. In this film, he does this when he's talking to John Blake as they're freeing the police, so he couldn't let anyone else around them potentially hear him, and with Catwoman as she's preparing the bat-pod."

    {
      "question": "Why didn't Batman even attempt to blow up Bane with the Bat on the rooftop scene with Selina Kyle?",
      "answer": "For the same reason he didn't let the Joker keep falling after he threw him off the building in the previous film; Bruce said in the first film to Ra's about whether to execute a farmer who stole-\"I will not become an executioner\". That is what Joker in the second film calls Batman's \"one rule\". People might accidentally die because of his actions (such as fake Ra's Al Ghul in the 1st film, Harvey Dent in the second film, or the driver of the bomb truck in this film), but he will never purposefully take their life. Batman's adherence to this rule is shown in the rooftop scene when he knocks a gun out of Catwoman's hands and says \"No guns, no killing\". It would've been hypocritical for him to later shoot down Bane and his men with the Bat.In Frank Miller's graphic novel, The Dark Knight Returns, there's a similar theme when Batman confronts the leader of a notorious and vicious gang called The Mutants. Batman has a moment where he can simply fire a powerful cannon on the latest version of the Batmobile (which resembles a tank) and destroy his enemy with one shot. He chooses to fight the Mutant Leader hand-to-hand because of personal principles he'd adopted years before that prevent him from being an executioner."

      "question": "In the first fight, why didn't Batman focus his punches on Bane's face or use the sleep darts shown later in the film?",
      "answer": "A few times in the fight, Batman did try to focus his punches to Bane's mask, in which Bane tauntingly accepts. But, each time he did that, Bane would grab his fist after a hit or two to prevent him from punching it more. (Bane did the same thing in the second fight until Batman managed to overcome it.) So, Batman would just hit everything else since Bane would let him. Batman likely didn't have the darts on him at the time or else he likely would have used them on more of the guards."
    },
    {
      "question": "How was Bane able to withstand Batman's attacks without showing any signs of pain?",
      "answer": "It is stated by Bruce's caretaker that Bane's mask \"holds the pain at bay\" (most likely with morphine, as the prison doctor is stated to have been a morphine addict). This presumably resulted in Bane being at least partially, perhaps even fully, insensitive to Batman's attacks, for analgesics taken orally affect the central nervous systems and nerves around the body connected to it. Alternatively, as Bane says to Batman when they first face off, \"Peace has cost you your strength. Victory has defeated you,\" meaning that Batman's 8-year absence from training and fighting left him in a weakened state, so his hits had little to no effect on a seasoned combatant like Bane."

    {
      "question": "How did Bane know where Batman's armory and fusion core were located?",
      "answer": "In the film, Fox mentions that Applied Sciences was always officially shut down and mentioned, \"After your father died, Wayne Enterprises set up 14 different defense subsidiaries. I spent years putting the prototypes under one roof, my roof-to prevent it from getting in the wrong hands.\" The only reason why he would have done that is if Applied Sciences was still on the books before he was CEO. And it is the case, since in Batman Begins, Bruce, when asked by CEO Earl about which division in Wayne Enterprise he wants to work for, responded, \"Applied Sciences caught my eye.\" Applied Sciences was on the books before Fox was CEO; even if it was shut down in Batman Begins, given that the lights were off, and Fox called the division a \"dead-end\" when Bruce first visited it.Since Ra's Al Ghul mentioned to Bruce in Batman Begins, \"you are defending a city so corrupt that we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure\", the League would be aware of Applied Sciences when it infiltrated Wayne Enterprises in this first film. Fox put it off the books in The Dark Knight since the accountant Mr. Reese finds out that Applied Sciences' numbers didn't add up and the division disappeared overnight. In The Dark Knight Rises, since Miranda in her eight years as a board member would've noticed that the division isn't on the books anymore, she would assume that Bruce hid his armory from there, and the League would tell Bane about its original location when learning from the original League members.With regard to the fusion core, Bane was affiliated with Talia al Ghul, who had previously visited the chamber, so she would have told him its location."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Bruce imagine Ra's al Ghul appearing to him in the Pit?",
      "answer": "There are two factors that come into play:1. Bruce had just undergone serious physical trauma (getting his dislocated back reset without painkillers). Bruce had been strung up to straighten out his back; while the scene transition is instant, he had clearly been in that position for weeks. When Bruce's vertebra is put back into place, he had minor stubble on his face; when he looks up to see the apparition of Ra's al Ghul, he has long facial hair, almost the same as what he had at the beginning of the film.2. Bruce already had all the information that Ra's discusses with him. Learning about the fabled mercenary and knowing Ra's in person simply meant putting two and two together. By this time, Bruce had thought of the young child as the young Bane. In his dream, Ra's supports Bruce as he thinks Bane is the heir of Ra's al Ghul. If it was Ra's in reality, then he'd correct Bruce about his child. In the end, both Talia and Bane effectively confirm that Ra's was killed by Batman in the first film. Ra's in this film was just a hallucination, nothing more.Alternate meaning: Ra's mentions how immortality comes in many forms. Being alive in Bruce's mind provides him a form of immortality, and syncing up with Batman Begins has made him a sort of legend, in Bruce's mind and his successors in The League of Shadows. Additionally, Ra's al Ghul can be seen as immortal through his legacy. In the comics Ra's al Ghul is literally immortal via use of the Lazarus Pit. He is also obsessed with his legacy-finding a suitable successor to his position of \"Demon's Head\" (the literal meaning of \"Ra's al Ghul\", the head or leader of the League of Shadows). So to translate that to film, Nolan made Ra's al Ghul immortal through his legacy-through his heir (whether that be Bane or Talia). Bane's (and eventually Bruce Wayne's) prison in the film (a pit) acts as a literal interpretation of the Lazarus Pit from the source material: Ra's al Ghul's legacy rises from the pit to take over his task, making the position of Ra's al Ghul and his mission immortal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Bane wait 5 months to blow up Gotham?",
      "answer": "We know the bomb will explode in five months without doing anything with it, since Bane mentioned to Dr. Pavel in the reactor chamber: \"Five, by my calculations\". So he takes advantage of this time period to first torture Gotham as it in turn tortures Bruce. In the pit scene, Bane tells Bruce that he wants to torture \"not of your body, but of your soul\", instead of killing him since he doesn't fear death but welcomes it. He explains how he learned there is \"no true despair without hope\" because the Pit made the prisoners like \"shipwrecked men turning to sea water from uncontrollable thirst\"; so trying to save themselves will instead kill them. Bane pointed to a TV and said \"you will watch as I torture an entire city\" by feeding them a false sense of \"hope to poison their souls\" under the anarchy. That way, Gotham would reveal its evil nature to the world by \"clamoring each other to stay in the sun\". He said Bruce would then \"under(stand) the depth of (his) failure\"-that his work as Batman was fruitless. To Bane, Talia and The League of Shadows; Gotham is inherently evil and non redeemable for the eight-year of peace proved nothing about Gotham's good, with Gotham's citizens still being greedy and destructive when given the chance by Bane. So justifying the Ra's hallucination Bruce later had: \"the only victory (Bruce) could achieve was a lie. . . Gotham is beyond saving\". This Gotham will rot under anarchy theme as predicted by Joker in the previous movie: \"Their morals, their code... it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. You'll see- I'll show you... when the chips are down, these civilized people... they'll eat each other.\"It's worth noting that Bane and Talia took precautions necessary to ensure that the city was theirs for as long as their faux revolution would run. The threat of the bomb ensured that the good Gothamites and police officers on the surface wouldn't try to rise up to him, and that the government would be held at bay. Talia as Miranda Tate plugged herself into various resistance movements, which allowed Bane and his men to kill the special forces agents then hang them as a warning to not try anything; then later for Barsad and his team to capture Gordon along with his allies. Nobody outside of The League knew that Talia was the triggerman, which ensured their plans further. The only true way to stop the bomb was to reconnect it to the reactor, to which Talia would use the flood chambers to ensure it couldn't happen. After Batman revealed his signal to inspire the police and public so that Blake could lead an exodus, Bane believed that they couldn't have been stopped, then as the battle starts- he orders for one of the main tumblers to open fire on the police, to which Batman prevents. There was virtually no way of stopping Bane and Talia during this section of the film, hence Batman needing to fly the bomb out."

    {
      "question": "Why did the protector protect the child in the pit? Why did the prisoners help Bruce?",
      "answer": "The protector protected the child from the prisoners in the pit, because according to the caretaker prisoner, the protector wanted to \"[show] the others that this [child's] innocence was their redemption.\" We later found out Bane was the protector—so since he too was born in the pit and lived there as a child, he felt sympathy towards the child. The prisoners helped Bruce, because the prisoners weren't bad people. Long gone are the days the warlord owned the pit. The caretaker prisoner said, \"This is Bane's prison now. Bane would not want this story told.\" Thus, Bane owns this prison and uses it to lock up his enemies. Even if the audience missed this fact, they could assume that the prisoners would help each other out since once one man escapes, he can put the second rope—the supply rope—down into the pit so all can escape. And when Bruce escaped, he put that rope down back into the pit."

    {
      "question": "When Bane removed the core, why didn't Lucius flood the chambers?",
      "answer": "The flood does not decommission the bomb: Lucius and Bruce said that \"The bomb goes off in 12 hours unless we reconnect it to the reactor.\" So, only the reactor can decommission the bomb. The flood is to be used to destroy the reactor when the core is decommissioned and so nothing can turn the core on. For why Lucius didn't flood the chamber before the core was removed, Miranda told Batman she knows how to override reactor and how to override the flood: \"Fox told me how to override the reactor-including the emergency flood.\" We can deduce she learned this from Lucius before Bane got to the reactor since there is nothing to override if the core is already out of the reactor. So if Lucius would somehow activate the flood, she would override the flood. And we know she had a trigger for controlling the flood mechanism since she remotely flooded it at the end of the film.Assuming Lucius had a trigger too, he still couldn't flood it. All of Bane's men in the chamber were armed and three of these men and Bane were surrounding and watching Miranda, Lucius, and Pavel in that scene. So, he couldn't risk doing any suspicious movements for flooding the chamber. And up at the reactor controls, Bane was standing directly next to the controls and watching him put his hands on the screen so he couldn't do anything at the controls or Bane would stop him. Finally, from what Miranda said to Lucius: \"You kill this man and yourself and barley slow them down\", it signals to Lucius not only that Bane would get other board members to turn the reactor on, but also why she won't flood the chamber; he will also assume it'll be counterproductive, because Bane's men, being able-bodied, will not be slowed down and escape though the chamber's blast hole and still cause destruction with their men and tumblers, and he and the other board members will die pointlessly."

    {
      "question": "Why did Commissioner Gordon send every available cop into the sewer?",
      "answer": "The reason why he sent \"every available cop\" was he already had Foley send teams down into the sewer but couldn't find Bane and his men. In the hospital scene with Gordon, Foley, and Blake, Gordon asked about the tunnel searches and Foley said, \"We've had teams down there, but it's a huge network.\" Blake then gave Foley all the tunnel maps and then Gordon said, \"Get more men, work a grid. I want (Bane) found\", so they sent even more teams down there. But since they still couldn't find him and Foley informed Gordon that Bane kidnapped the Wayne Enterprise board and brought them into the sewer, Gordon then said, \"no more patrols, no more hide and seek\"; so the cops had already patrolled the sewers multiple times but couldn't find Bane's men since they were cat-and-mousing the cops. Since Gordon wanted to increase the chances of finding and cornering them, he said, \"send every available cop\" to \"smoke them out\". There was a massive network to navigate with Gordon unsure where Bane and his men were nor how many there were, in addition to the fact they recently attacked the city's stock exchange and are holding Wayne Enterprises hostage in order to hijack the fusion reactor.The audience must remember that Gordon only sent \"every available cop\", not necessarily every cop, in order to smoke out Bane's army. There still is a significant back bone of the force remaining on the street, making up the resistance. This is shown in the scene behind the meat store where the Special Forces ask Gordon, Foley and Blake how many cops are left. Gordon says there are \"dozens of us but (he) preferred not to say.\" And we can see many of these surviving cops standing behind Gordon in the scene and later helping him out in the film. Unfortunately, these cops were heavily outnumbered by Bane's mercenaries. Plus, Foley called back many of his officers from the tunnel when Blake informed him that the cops were heading into the trap. Finally, the cops left on the surface are shown to be older than the ones sent running to the sewer. This means that the veteran cops were left behind to continue policing on the surface, since they aren't as able bodied to fight the army unlike the younger cops. An example is the older cop that chased Batman in the beginning of the film and told the younger cop, \"you are in for a show tonight son.\" He is later seen standing next to Gordon in the meat shop and later scenes."

    {
      "question": "How is it possible that the cops do not show any sign of beard growth after being buried in the tunnels for all that time?",
      "answer": "Bane told Bruce Wayne in the Pit that he wanted to feed the people of Gotham \"hope to poison their souls\". Bane said in his speech outside of Black Gate that the police would survive and at the same time a scene in the film is shown of the underground cops getting provisions drawn down to them by rope, which were sent via the bridge and then distributed to them. We see hygiene equipment like sheets, jugs, and pots in the scene, so we can assume other hygiene equipment like razors in order to keep illness from spreading was provided too."

    {
      "question": "Was Gotham in a recession? And why did Gothamites participate in Bane's revolution if he is a terrorist?",
      "answer": "Yes. The recession was probably caused by Wayne Enterprise and started 3 years before the film. That is because the company is in a slump; according to a conversation between Bruce and Lucius, Bruce lost most of the company's money in the fusion reactor investment and not using it to regain profits. As Lucius said, Bruce funneled the entire R and D budget for five years into a fusion project that he then mothballed, his company is unlikely to thrive. Since the orphanage's Father Reilly said the orphanage was \"not for a couple years now\" funded by the Wayne Foundation, which according to Alfred is funded by the profits of Wayne Enterprises, that means Wayne Enterprise is very low on profits with only the Dent Day event still being funded. For Wayne Enterprises, all this loss of financial capital causes less output, a lot of layoffs in the company, stockholders lose money, investments in and out of the company decrease, public works and non-profits like orphanages it used to fund stop, and any economic work-the kind Ra's mentioned that Thomas Wayne's W.E. did that saved Gotham in Batman Begins-is undone. Since Wayne Enterprise is the predominant economic force, conglomerate and thus employer in Gotham, this causes a domino effect similar to the real life 2008 housing industry bubble collapse in which a flailing major industry affects all other industries. So, since Wayne Enterprise and former employees can't do as much business with the other Gotham industries, there is even less output and layoffs there too, leading to decreased economic activity in Gotham. That is why when the outgrown orphan boys went to find jobs; Mark, the orphan that John Blake speaks to said there was \"more work in the sewer than you can find up here (on the surface).\"The layoffs, lack of jobs and lower pay in the recession caused a wealth gap between the rich and the poor/middle class, since the latter suffer the most in the recession from having less savings and capital to recover with than the rich. This causes class tension between them, and a distrust of capitalism among the non-rich if small businesses fail and industries won't hire them. Selina mocked Bruce that the poor are soon going to be able to get revenge on the rich: \"There's a storm coming. . .(for) you and your friends. . .when it hits you're all gonna wonder how you ever thought you could live so large and leave so little for the rest of us\". Also, a reporter mocked Bruce when he lost all of his money by saying \"how does it feel to be one of the people?\" The gap and tension helped justify Gothamites to participate in Bane's wealth distribution revolution. Once Bane took over and threatened to blow up the city if citizens did not oblige to his revolution, Gothamites have nothing more to lose but to do what Bane said in the football stadium: \"claim what is rightfully (theirs)\" as Bane later in front of Blackgate that Gothamites were oppressed by the rich and \"myth of opportunity\". Plus, Gothamites didn't know the decaying fuel cells would cause the bomb to go off in 5 months since Bane only mentioned it in the reactor chamber, not the public. Thus, assuring the people to trust Bane's revolution further. (Only Bruce's allies would know, since Lucius and Miranda helped build the reactor and know its properties and would share the info with Gordon and Blake. And Bruce would already know this, since he helped build the reactor.)It's implied that not everyone gave into Bane's cause, this can be compared similarly in real life to how not everyone in World War II Germany gave into Adolf Hitler's cause. Certain citizens stayed in hiding like the St. Swithin's orphanage, Foley's family. When the Special Forces agents are handing out rations outside a grocery store a line of people are seen waiting in line, presumably working class people. The special forces agents are then led by a grocery store clerk to Gordon and his allies who are in hiding. The building where the special forces meet with Lucius Fox and Miranda Tate before they're ambushed is shown to have a number of Wayne Enterprises employees living in poverty. During the final battle many middle class citizens are rallied by Blake and the orphans to try and leave the city during the final battle, and after the bomb's detonation, citizens are seen coming out of their homes including a couple embracing."

Bane's plan for Gotham was to \"feed its people hope to poison their souls.\" Telling them the truth with concrete evidence supporting the speech's authenticity doesn't feed Gothamites hope. The ambiguity of the speech's authenticity would torture and confuse Gothamites for months since they would be conflicted about whether or not the system lied to them for eight years and martyred a corrupt man for peace. This ambiguity would worsen since Many Gothamites would already know from Dent Day's attendees and press that Gordon looked uncomfortably and said \"the time isn't right\" before putting away his speech-so there was already suspicious about the truth of Dent. The public would already know Gordon was attacked in the sewer and ended up in the hospital, thus they'd figure that Bane originally came from the sewer since he rigged it up to trap the police, the public would uncomfortably theorize that Bane got the speech from him in the sewer.2. Justify the 1,000 prisoners into loyalty to him in the revolution \"so an army will be raised\" for him. Freeing them without cause may not be enough since the 1,000 criminals probably outnumber Bane's men and Bane doesn't want them attacking his men, so he wants the former to be part of his army. And we know the prisoners are loyal to Bane since the prisoners run the kangaroo courts for Bane and not against the mercenaries. Plus, the unfairness of being locked up for good by being denied parole because of a lie martyring a violent criminal justifies to prisoners to attack and prosecute any remaining cops and authorities which is what Bane wants.3. Diminish the morale of the remaining surface police to weaken their morale, make them vulnerable to capture, and torture Bruce in the pit."

      "question": "Why did Bane not tell Gotham that he had defeated Batman? Wouldn't it be more frightening for the people to know that there is no one there to save them?",
      "answer": "Bane's plan was \"to feed (Gotham's) people hope to poison their souls\". There is no reason for him to say he beat and imprisoned Batman if he wanted people to have hope that he is still out there. Nevertheless, if he would have told them that Batman was defeated from the first place, it would be possible that people, knowing that they have nothing to lose, could rise against him and the League of Shadows."

    {
      "question": "Why didn't Bane tell Gotham Batman's true identity?",
      "answer": "Bane wouldn't reveal this because it would impede his plans as well as the overall mission of Talia al Ghul and The League of Shadows. Citizens wouldn't be able to hate the rich and powerful if the wealthiest man in Gotham, Bruce Wayne, was revealed to be the one who risked his life for them. This is crucial since Gordon's speech proves Batman's innocence in the deaths of the people Harvey Dent killed, Dent kidnapping Gordon's family and the latter's attempted murder of Gordon's son."

      "question": "Why is it that no one thought to spread out on their stomachs with their arms and legs out to make it across the ice?",
      "answer": "One of the Blackgate ex-cons tells Stryver (Daggett's assistant) that if he tries to \"swim\" across the ice, he will be dead in minutes. It's a very long way across, and crawling would cause the body parts exposed to the ice (even through clothes) to become extremely frostbitten and result in hypothermia and death. Stryver is also wearing only the suit he had on during his \"trial,\" which offers him very little protection from the freezing temperatures. Walking is his best bet. Furthermore, the ex-cons and Bane's men were probably under orders to shoot anyone not walking on two feet. The point isn't to let exiles cross the ice safely; it's to give them the \"hope\" that they will survive (similar to what Bane talks about earlier) before the inevitable fall and death."

      "question": "How did Bruce find Selina when he returned to Gotham?",
      "answer": "Selina mentioned in that scene, \"You boys know you can't come into my neighborhood without asking politely.\" Thus, that scene's setting was her neighborhood. And Bruce had visited her neighborhood before in a previous scene in the film when John Blake drove him to her house. So he just checked each street in her neighborhood until he found her. Nevertheless, whether the audience missed out on this fact or not, Bruce Wayne is known to locate people easily. For example, in The Dark Knight, Batman located Maroni in a club and then located Harvey Dent who was secretly interrogating Thomas Schiff in a dark alley in the following scene."

    {
      "question": "Why does Batman waste time constructing the Fiery Batsignal on the bridge?",
      "answer": "Batman has always been more than just a man, an icon of fear among the Gotham underworld, a beacon of hope. The mere presence of his sign provided the hope to all Gothamites that their valiant knight had returned to their side. This is the very reason that inspires the massive number of cops waiting the next morning (Foley being an example of many unknown): The symbol of Batman gave them the spirit to stand up against a superior force. This also enables John Blake and the orphans to be able to rally a number of good citizens of Gotham to try and leave the city though prevented from doing so by police working under Bane's thumb.Bruce either made the signal right before he talked to Selina when he got back, or made it years before in case a threat like that of Bane ever arose and that Batman only needed to position it and ignite it. This controversy of when Batman made the signal can be similarly compared to how, in The Dark Knight, Joker had time to rig the biggest hospital in Gotham and two ferries with bombs. Just like we can assume Joker did it earlier off-screen, we can assume Batman did his earlier off-screen too."

    {
      "question": "How does Batman beat Bane in the second fight? Isn't Bane supposed to be physically superior?",
      "answer": "Several factors come into play.1. He fights more strategically in their second battle by going for what he now knows is Bane's weak spot, the mask, taking blows in order to expose Bane's vulnerability. Batman eventually damaged the mask with the blades on his gauntlets, which leaves Bane severely weakened and distracted as he needs an anesthetic pumped into his lungs continually to dull the pain from injuries he suffered in prison.2. Batman's mental training and fear of Bane may have also driven his survival anger to a higher level, as is common for trained combatants in life-threatening situations.3. Bruce worked out extensively in prison to get himself as close to the physical prime he had eight years earlier (Bruce is noticeably exhausted rather quickly in his first fight with Bane).4. When Batman first faced off with Bane, he had seriously underestimated Bane as a threat. Alfred told him this while viewing the footage of Bane in the stock exchange, and that Bane was faster and more agile than Bruce's condition after eight years out of the job."

    {
      "question": "Is it possible Bane is still alive?",

    {
      "question": "Why did the League want to destroy Gotham if it isn't corrupt?",
      "answer": "The primary reason why the League wants to destroy Gotham was because Talia wanted to avenge her father's murder by finishing his work of destroying Gotham: \"I honor my father by finishing his work. Vengeance against the man who killed him is simply a reward for my patience.\" After Ra's excommunicated Bane, Talia said she couldn't \"truly forgive (her) father-until (Bruce) murdered him\". That is when Talia finally cherished her father's importance in her life. Ra's in Batman Begins' campfire scene taught Bruce about how \"Vengeance\" against the ones who hurt his \"loved one\" saved him and asks Bruce, \"why you don't avenge your parent's murder?\"Avenging loved ones is something he would have taught Talia and he did for Talia had used the League to do what she called \"exact terrible vengeance\" on the prisoners of the pit since they killed her mother and hurt her protector Bane. So when Ra's died, Talia would honor him for what he did in her life-he had helped her avenge her mother's murder and what the prisoners did to Bane-and because \"he took us in. Trained us\". Ra's rescuing Bane and training him so he didn't have to live his whole life in pain forever in prison overrides her father excommunicating him from the League, since Ra's had done more good for Bane than bad.Nevertheless, when Talia became Miranda and infiltrated Wayne Enterprises eight years ago, she didn't destroy Gotham for she would have learned Bruce rid Gotham from criminal control. So she wanted to financially fix Gotham and save the world with what she called \"free clean energy for the entire city\" and the \"world's best chance for a sustainable future\": the fusion reactor. But since Bruce enraged her by mothballing it five years in and ruined her project from seeing the daylight because of the reactor-to-bomb paper, she never forgot what Bruce did to her father because of \"the knife that waits years without forgetting\" and finally wanted to destroy Gotham by using the core as a bomb to rub it in his face.When Miranda gave Bruce another chance by taking control of the reactor, Bruce still wouldn't let her use it since when she asked what she did with it, he said, \"Nothing, until we can find a way to guarantee its safety.\" Bruce also said they will \"Decommission it (and) flood it.\", if she doesn't do it. Nevertheless, after Bane found Gordon's letter, the League then regained its original reason to destroy Gotham for Bruce's work was built on a lie that allowed the whole mob to be locked up for good despite Dent being a murderer; Dent's prosecution of locking the whole mob up should have been undone in appeal and the Dent Act had no right to deny parole. Thus, Bruce and all law enforcement are just as corrupt and unjust as the criminals.Gotham is even more corrupt than eight years ago for now both the good and bad guys are corrupt. Thus, whether the reactor would be used for its original purpose of saving Gotham didn't matter anymore. In the words of decoy Ra's Al Ghul explaining the League's goal in the first film: \"Gotham's time has come. Like Constantinople or Rome before it the city has become a breeding ground for suffering and injustice. It is beyond saving and must be allowed to die. This is the most important function of the League of Shadows. It is one we've performed for centuries. Gotham... must be destroyed.\""
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Bane want to destroy Gotham if Ra's Al Ghul excommunicated him?",
      "answer": "The film addresses this twice: Bane is shown to hate his excommunication but the film gives us his two motivations for destroying Gotham right after his excommunication is mentioned.1. Bane was angry when Bruce mentioned it. That is because he considers himself part of the League-\"and you betrayed us\"-and considers the League as his family. This is demonstrated when one of his cohorts in the opening scene is willing to stay until his death: \"No, they expect one of us in the wreckage, brother\". Take note that this cult-like dynamic of the League doesn't include the two men in the sewer that Bane killed as they weren't true League members, but thugs he hired in the recession since unlike the mercenaries in that scene, the thugs don't have mercenary clothing, were not confident or loyal, questioned Bane, and lacked League demeanor. Because Bane loves the League, he snarled at Bruce for he hates that Bruce betrayed the League. So when Bruce mentioned to Bane, \"you were excommunicated by a gang of psychopaths\", Bane went berserk and then confidently boasted, \"I am the League of Shadows, and I am here to fulfill Ra's Al Ghuls' destiny!\" By calling himself the League, he is showing how devoted he is to the League and will fulfill Ra's destiny to prove to his ego he shouldn't have been excommunicated. And since he hates Bruce for betraying the League and more or less replacing him, Bane wants to prove his superiority to Bruce. He proves this by physically and tactically out maneuvering Bruce, saying, \"The shadows betray you because they belong to me.\" He is so confident that he is superior to Bruce that he thought Bruce couldn't escape the pit: \"I broke you-how did you come back?\". If Bane is superior to Bruce and Bane never escaped the pit by himself, therefore, Bruce also can't escape the pit. And because of his sense of superiority towards Bruce, he secretly disobeyed Talia by almost killing Bruce-that means his hatred of Bruce Wayne rivals his love for Talia, one of his primary motivations.2. Bane started shedding tears when Talia mentioned Ra's excommunicated Bane from the League of Shadows. That is because he loved Talia-\"His only crime is that he loved me\". According to the prison caretaker, Bane loved her to prove to the other prisoners her \"innocence was their redemption\". So, Bane wanted to redeem himself by helping a fellow innocent child born in the pit like him. Bane saving her led to him being rewarded with Talia having Ra's Al Ghul exact terrible vengeance on the prisoners that hurt Bane and killed her mother, Ra's rescuing him, taking him into the League, and training him. When her father kicked him out, she didn't forgive him and ran away with Bane. We know she did this since Ra's never told Bruce about Talia because of their estranged relationship. So all of this shows Talia loves Bane back (platonically, not as lovers). When Talia inherited the League and planned to destroy Gotham for her father, she undid the excommunication, allowing him to be part of League, in which he will be happy to rejoin the organization he loved and fulfill Ra's Al Ghul's destiny. So, Bane will destroy Gotham also for Talia because of what she did for him."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Bane, Talia's \"lackey\"?",
      "answer": "There are two interpretations:1. He isn't, and that he and Talia are collaborators. They were both leaders in their own right, as Bane was the field commander of both the League and faux revolution. The fact that he and Talia are partners and accomplices doesn't rob him of his value or any of his deeds throughout the film, but adds to him. After Talia instructed Bane to not kill Batman in the judicial hall, Bane- having felt crushed by Batman's return and defeat by him in their second battle- disobeys her and attempts to kill Batman as he felt he had almost nothing left. If he was an absolute lackey or henchman to her, he wouldn't have done this.2. He is, and that isn't a bad thing. The characterization of being a lackey comes from destroying Gotham at its root being Talia's idea and Bane's primary motivation for doing it is out of his love for Talia. This characterization comes from A Tale of Two Cities, in which the film draws much influence from, since Talia is based on Madame Defarge and Bane is based on Monsieur Defarge. In that novel, it appeared to be that it was Monsieur Defarge's idea to cause the revolution for he is shown finding the letter, leading the storming of Bastille, using his store as a planning hub for the revolutionaries, etc. But, it is later revealed near the end that it was Madame Defarge's idea for she wanted to avenge her family's murder and her husband Monsieur Defarge did it out of his love for her. Nevertheless, Mr. Defarge still believed in the revolution bringing justice to France so he had this other motivation to do it. Likewise, Bane believes Gotham is corrupt from working with Daggett, observing the wealth gap, and discovering Gordon's letter.) The film takes a risk to make the audience assume Bane is Talia's lackey. That is because it wants the audience to make the connection that Bane is Talia's Alfred. \"Lackey\" by definition means \"man-servant\". If Talia is an anti-Bruce, for both are orphans, businessmen, ninjas, and want to avenge their father's murder by destroying/saving Gotham, then she must have a man-servant too. And Bane is her anti-Alfred, for he is intelligent, older, skilled, and loves their surrogate child as an adoptive father (Bane appears about 20 years older than Talia in the present and the flashback scenes). And the parallels between protagonists and antagonists are based on the \"duality\" aspect drawn from A Tale of Two Cities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did the League wait 8 years to destroy Gotham and why use the fusion reactor bomb to destroy Gotham instead of easily getting some other nuclear bomb?",
      "answer": "They waited 8 years so-in Banes words-\"peace has cost (Bruce) his strength\" mentally and physically so he can't fight back and to see Gotham's state after Batman's impact. Considering Talia took on the Miranda alias and asked Bruce to help invest in the what Lucius called \"first of its kind\" fusion project, we can assume for 5 years she wanted to observe post-Batman Gotham. The energy project was in her words \"to invest to restore balance to the world\" by providing \"free clean energy to the entire city\". If Dr. Pavel's paper was never published, Gotham would be at peace from both Batman's work and the reactor's economic impact. But because of the weaponized fusion reactor paper, 3 years prior to the events of the film, Bruce claimed the reactor had problems and would not allow anyone to use it. Talia was then angry at Bruce for ruining what she called \"the world's best chance for a sustainable future\"; revenge for her father kicked in and she and Bane then planned for 3 years to use it as a way to keep the government at bay and put Gotham in a 5-month occupation and social experiment to reveal Gothamites' evil nature and torture Bruce.She couldn't just steal the reactor to be used for its original purpose, since Wayne Enterprise would catch on to it, nor could she ask some other investor to help make another reactor since the reactor is very expensive-as it nearly bankrupted Wayne-and Bruce said the reactor had problems-no one would invest in something that could fail. The League couldn't use any other bomb since unlike the reactor's fusion-based/neutron bomb, other nuclear bombs leave significant radioactive waste and that is against the League's \"restore balance to the world\" philosophy. For obtaining a neutron bomb, handling a team of CIA agents and mercenaries in order to kidnap Dr. Pavel that can turn the reactor in Gotham into a bomb is more efficient than infiltrating heavily guarded military facilities to directly steal and somehow handle a neutron bomb and bring it to Gotham safely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Were Bane and the League of Shadows on a suicide mission?",
      "answer": "It's implied they were on a suicide mission from the very beginning. In the opening prologue, Bane tells one of his men to stay in the plane because the CIA expect to find one of them in the wreckage. The man complies unquestionably and seems almost proud that he could die for Bane's cause. Additionally, Stryver quotes Bane, saying his men would \"die before talking\" when Daggett asked about his captured men from the stock heist. All this showcases that all of Bane's men were fully and completely committed to Bane and the League's mission, perfectly ready and willing to sacrifice themselves to see it through. At the end of the film, when Talia reveals herself to Batman, she, without hesitation presses the trigger to detonate the bomb while her, Bane and all their men are still in the city limits. The bomb fails to detonate, however. Then they try to do whatever they can to see that it goes off. So since the League seem to have no qualms about dying, it seems they had no intention of evacuating themselves before the bomb went off. They probably knew that if they wanted to completely take control of Gotham for any length of time, they wouldn't be able to get very far before the surrounding National Guard would capture or kill them, so the only option was to occupy the city until the very end.An alternate possibility was that they had planned to evacuate shortly before the bomb went off. The bomb had a blast radius of six miles, which wouldn't take very long to get to a safe distance from. It's possible they could have cleared the tunnel or flown out and escaped. When the bomb went off, the military would likely be in a state of shock trying to figure out what happened and the League of Shadows could make their escape relatively unnoticed as the military would likely assume something went wrong and the bomb went off accidentally. This plan being foiled when Batman and 3,000 police officers overran their base of operations. Another element that makes the possibility of them planning to escape likely is that Talia desired revenge against Bruce. Her speech about the slow knife she delivers after stabbing Batman supports this. It's possible they planned to evacuate before the bomb exploded so Talia could return to the pit, reveal her true identity, and kill him."

    {
      "question": "How come Bruce's caretaker and the doctor never corrected to Bruce that Bane was actually the protector?",
      "answer": "In the pit scene, his caretaker is telling Bruce the story of the one escapee of the pit. He mentions that one child born in the pit long ago escaped the pit. Considering the fact he knew Bane was born in the pit and escaped, Bruce assumed the child was Bane. So Bruce asked the caretaker, \"Is Bane the child you spoke of? Was he born here?, but the caretaker ignored the question and still went on with the story. By the time the caretaker told Bruce that the child who escaped had a protector sympathetic towards him and a mother who then died, the prison doctor, upset that the caretaker mentioned his failure of forgetting to lock her cell, told him to be quiet. Thus, the caretaker never got the chance to fully tell Bruce the truth. By not telling him, this gave Bruce the courage to climb the pit. If Bane could climb the pit, he could too. If the caretaker told him the truth that it wasn't Bane but another child who escaped, Bruce wouldn't have the courage to climb.Bruce at that time didn't know the other child was Talia, since he neither heard of Talia as Ra's al Ghul had never made any reference to family outside of his \"great love\", nor who she impersonated, until the end of the film. This is something the prisoners would not be familiar with too, because they aren't familiar that Talia is Miranda Tate. It's also very likely that the caretaker and the doctor feared what Bane might do to them if they revealed this to Bruce and Bane found out."

    {
      "question": "Shouldn't the signal blocker have been removed to once again try the trigger?",
      "answer": "Two reasons:1. The signal blocker was the EMP cannon-guidance mount that Bruce received from the Bat when he asked Lucius what could block the signal. EMP weaponry would completely fry a targeted electronic device if it's strong enough or if the targeted device is complex in circuitry, for it is susceptible to overheating. Gordon put the blocker at point-blank range to the bomb. The device that connects the trigger and bomb together is bound to be complex in circuitry because of the complexity of starting a nuclear reaction. So, these factors guarantee that the device connecting the trigger to the bomb would be completely fried by the EMP blocker and removing the blocker would be pointless.2. There was only minutes until the bomb goes off and Talia had just flooded the chambers to prevent it from being stabilized, so she just needed to protect the bomb and let it go off on its own."

    {
      "question": "Why does Bruce say \"Batman could be anybody\" to Blake when he didn't approve of the Batman impersonators in the previous movie?",
      "answer": "Bruce Wayne disapproved of the copycats because Bruce said, \"That isn't exactly what I meant when I said I wanted to inspire people,\" because he didn't want citizens to use vigilantism.In Batman Begins, Bruce said, I'm gonna show the people of Gotham their city doesn't belong to the criminals and the corrupt.... People need dramatic examples to shake them out of apathy, and I can't do that as Bruce Wayne. As a man, I'm flesh and blood. I can be ignored. I can be destroyed. But as a symbol...I can be incorruptible. I can be everlasting...something elemental, something terrifying. Bruce became Batman to inspire people to fight against Gotham's corrupt and criminal. This works, according to the fake Batman that Joker interrogated, \"[by Batman being] a symbol; that we don't have to be afraid of scum like you\", Bruce became a vigilante since the legal system was too corrupt to be used effectively against the evils. Bruce wanted to cleanse the legal system of the mobs' control.In The Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne and Commissioner Gordon put all their faith in Harvey Dent, because he was the beacon of hope that Gotham City needed. Bruce wanted to inspire people that had a face that used legal means to fight criminals, not vigilantism. Bruce affirmed this by saying \"exactly\" after Natasha, Bruce's date, told Harvey, \"Gotham needs heroes like youelected officialsnot a man who thinks he is above the law.\" Batman then confirmed this to Dent: \"You are the symbol of hope I could never be. You are the first legitimate ray of light in Gotham in decades.\" The problem with having a public face, is the criminals know who to attack. Harvey lost Rachel and his own sanity because he was such a public figure for hope. After Harvey Dent became insane and goes on a killing spree, Batman told Gordon to pin Dent's crimes on him, reasoning, \"I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be. Right now, it needs its true hero [Harvey Dent].\"In The Dark Knight Rises, Bruce tells Gordon in the hospital the \"Batman wasn't needed anymore we won\". But, Gordon tells him about an \"evil rising\" and tells Bruce that \"Batman has to come back\". So, Bruce learns that vigilantism is still needed even if the police have finally conquered organized crime because of greater threats like Bane. He told Alfred that he didn't give Bane's USB drive to the police since \"they don't have the tools to analyze it\" and he didn't trust them out of fear of Banes infiltration: \"one man's tool is another man's weapon.\" So, like in the past, in case the police needs help for more than they can handle, there must be a Batman—and he later chooses Blake as his successor. Bruce Wayne tells Blake to wear a mask when fighting criminals in order to \"protect the people [he] care[s] about\". Bruce also states that he became Batman in order to \"be a symbol—Batman could be anybody, that was the point\". And this point explains the mechanics on exactly how people like the Batmen or Harvey were inspired and not afraid of scum in the first place. Since, Batman could be anyone, that means it is feasible for anyone to fix Gotham and not be afraid to do it for the person who was Batman wasn't afraid. And Dent, in The Dark Knight, apparently was inspired from Batman being anyone, for he said, \"Gotham city is proud for an ordinary citizen standing up for what's right\", after Natasha had mocked the masked vigilante. So, Bruce never meant for people to impersonate him; rather, he wanted to inspire people to not be afraid and use legal means to fix Gotham."

She plans to complete her father's work by detonating the bomb and destroying Gotham, but Gordon blocks her signal, preventing remote detonation. Talia goes after the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Selina kills Bane using the Batpod. Batman pursues Talia with the Bat, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she reveals to Batman, Gordon, and Selina that she has overridden the reactor as well as the emergency flood, leaving no way to stop the bomb from exploding. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman flies the bomb over the bay and drops it in the water, where it detonates. Batman is presumed dead and is honored as a hero. With Bruce also presumed dead, Wayne Manor is left to the city to become an orphanage, and Wayne's remaining estate is left to Alfred. Fox discovers that Bruce had fixed the Bat's autopilot, and Gordon finds the Bat-Signal refurbished. While visiting Florence, Alfred sees Bruce and Selina together.

    {
      "question": "Wouldn't a nuclear bomb have caused significant nuclear fallout once detonated?",
      "answer": "The bomb was a \"weaponized fusion reactor\" according to Dr. Pavel's paper. Thus, it can be considered a fusion-based nuclear bomb. Normal nuclear bombs split radioactive elements into highly radioactive elements because they use fission. The fusion reactor only uses fusion. Fusion still has radiation i.e. heat, light, etc., but it has little to no radioactive waste-the only of sorts would be fast neutrons which would be absorbed by the water with no ill effects. Later, Dr. Pavel specified to the public in the stadium that it was a neutron bomb. So \"weaponized fusion reactor\" really meant the conversion of the fusion core into a neutron bomb. Although it has more radiation than normal nuclear bombs, the neutron bomb's radioactive waste would dissipate to safe levels quickly and the fallout would lose significance as distance increases from the original detonation point. This would also be in keeping with the League of Shadows' motives. Their intention is to destroy Gotham and its corrupt inhabitants in order to restore balance to the world-ruining the environment is not \"The movement back to harmony\" that Ra's mentioned in the first film. Since the bomb was detonated many miles away from the city, Gotham would be fine."

      "question": "Would the explosion at sea have caused a tsunami?",
      "answer": "No. In nuclear explosions tested at sea there were no reported tsunamis. Potentially there would have been higher waves but nothing significant. Tsunamis are generally caused by earthquakes or volcanic activity, and these have the potential to be much, much more powerful than any nuclear weapon. For example, the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake and subsequent tsunami that devastated Japan is believed to have released energy equivalent to 9,320 gigatons of TNT-several orders of magnitude more powerful than the 50-megaton Tsar Bomba (the most powerful nuclear weapon ever built), and certainly more powerful than the 4-megaton nuke featured in this film. When a tsunami is formed, it happens because of seismic activity deep under the ocean's surface. When tectonic plates shift you either have volcanic activity or earthquakes. Because it happens deep below the surface of the water, much more water is displaced than would be by a nuclear blast."

    {
      "question": "How did Batman escape from the Bat and not get killed in the nuclear blast?",
      "answer": "He ejected from the Bat before it flew out over the Bay. Immediately before he boarded the Bat, Selina Kyle suggested that he would eject, but Batman said he could not because the plane had \"no autopilot.\" It turned out, however, that the plane did have autopilot—Bruce Wayne had fixed the autopilot through a software patch, as revealed in Lucius's Fox later scene where he is studying the autopilot software on the silver-colored development prototype Bat. Batman evidently ejected from the plane sometime between boarding it and when the bomb detonated. We actually see him push a lever while in flight, but the scene cuts away before revealing this lever's effect. John Blake and the orphans then view an explosion near a building, followed by the Bat flying over the bay. This explosion would hide Batman's ejection from the public's view. We do not see Batman in the Bat between the explosion and the bomb's detonation. We do see one shot of him, but it is a close-up that does not show the larger Bat. This closeup shows him turning another lever, as though piloting an aircraft, though the Bat traveled a straight path at this point. This shot therefore depicted the ejected cockpit rather than the entire Bat aircraft. Similarly, in The Dark Knight, the Batmobile ejected a self-contained vehicle (the Batpod). Also, in listening carefully, it is clear that the sound of the engine of the Bat in the scene which was previously mentioned doesn't sound mechanical at all (we just hear an electric buzz); although in the following exterior shots, the propellers of the Bat are clearly heard which might indicates that Batman boards a different vehicle with electric engines—different than the propeller-powered Bat—thus proving that he had indeed ejected."

      "answer": "No, it isn't. Batman's Bat, which is black colored, was presumably destroyed in the explosion. The machine Lucius checks in the end of the movie is the silver prototype, in which is also shown in the beginning of the film when Bruce was checking out the Applied Sciences department. In that scene, Bruce is touching the grey prototype on the left side of the screen while the audience can see in the background a silver prototype that looks finished on its left side but missing large chunks of parts on its right side and back. Apparently, the grey prototype was finished so he painted it black and gave it to Bruce. At the end of the film, we see that the inspected prototype is silver and still missing its right wing and the right cannon mount isn't shelled up. So Lucius checks this to find any hints of autopilot programming, since the programming would presumably go on all models."

      "question": "Didn't people find it convenient that Batman and Bruce Wayne both died around the same time as each other?",
      "answer": "Bruce Wayne's last public appearance was about two or three days after the stock exchange robbery. He disappears shortly afterwards due to the fact that he was crippled by Bane and taken to the Pit. Since Bruce is not seen in public after this, he, being associated with the \"bourgeoisie\" in Bane's revolution, is assumed to have been killed in the city-wide riots or the kangaroo trials that followed Bane's takeover. He returns to Gotham less than a day before the bomb detonates, and the only people who see him in the hostage room are Selina, Fox and Miranda, plus the few thugs and hostages present.Bruce's last public appearance was a day after Bane's stock exchange robbery, then he goes missing and the revolution happens which targeted the wealthy and the judicial system. Bruce isn't seen by anyone else except in the hostage room when rescuing Lucius Fox, so by the end, he's presumed dead- especially with his funeral being only exclusive to Alfred, Lucius Fox, James Gordon, and John Blake. John Blake, upset with the fact no one else knew Bruce was Batman said, \"no one's ever going to know who saved an entire city.\" So officially, people do not connect the two deaths.Nevertheless, there probably are conspiracy theories about Bruce, stemming back to Batman first appearing months after Bruce came back from the dead in the first film to what happened to Bruce after Lucius took him out of that hostage room in the third film."

      "question": "What does Alfred mean when he says, \"I've failed you\", and why did he leave Bruce earlier in the film?",
      "answer": "Alfred said, \"I failed you, you trusted me, and I failed you'', to the gravestone of Thomas and Martha Wayne, Bruce's parents. Alfred is overcome with grief from Bruce's death because he had been Bruce's caretaker since Bruce was born, and cared for him after Mr. and Mrs. Wayne died. His parents trusted Alfred to protect Bruce but he didn't since he went along with Bruce as Batman 8 years ago. Thus, when Bruce was going to be Batman again and fight Bane-someone that can outclass and kill him, Alfred didn't want to support Bruce being Batman anymore: \"(Gotham) doesn't need your body, or your life. That time has passed\". Alfred later told Bruce, You see only one end to your story. Leaving is all I have to make you understand: you aren't Batman anymore-you have to find another way. You used to talk about finishing. About life beyond that awful cave. Alfred tried to convince Bruce that there was more to life than being Batman, but Bruce wanted things to go bad again so he could be Batman. So, Alfred threatened to leave so Bruce wouldn't be Batman again. But Bruce shook it off, making Alfred keep his word and leave, and his fears were realized at the end of the film. Consequently, he felt he failed Bruce's parents. In the comics, KnightQuest: The Search, Alfred left Bruce too after he found out he was going to face Bane again-he worried that Bane would beat him again and kill him."

      "question": "Was Selina Kyle wearing Martha Wayne's pearl necklace at the ending cafe scene?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Is Alfred dreaming the cafe scene in the end of the movie? If not, how did he happen to cross paths with Bruce?",
      "answer": "No, Alfred is not dreaming. Early in the film, Alfred tells Bruce about a fantasy he had back when Bruce had originally ran away from Gotham for 7 years. Alfred would be on a holiday in Italy, and would go to a cafe by the Arno River in Florence every day at noon, and order a Fernet Branca. Every day he would be hoping that he would just happen to come across Bruce there, possibly now with a wife and children. Alfred wouldn't say anything to Bruce, and vice-versa, but Alfred would know that Bruce had made it and started a new life, free from the death, pain and misery that Gotham held for Bruce.At the end of the film, Alfred, believing Bruce to be dead, continues with his tradition of going to the cafe in Italy during his holiday. On one particular day, he sees Bruce sitting at the table across from him with Selina Kyle. Alfred nods at Bruce and Bruce nods to Alfred. This might seem too coincidental, hence the suggestion by some that Alfred is simply dreaming it. However, as pointed out by the lawyer near the end of the film saying, \"we can't leave a string of pearls on the manifest as lost\", Martha Wayne's pearl necklace (the one Bruce used to find Selina in the beginning of the film) is missing from Bruce's possessions. Selina can be seen wearing the necklace in the cafe scene, implying that the scene is intended to be real, something which has been confirmed by several sources. Or, Alfred could have found them by using the tracking device on the necklace to find Bruce, since Bruce did the same thing to find Selina earlier in the film.Other things that need to be taken into account are Fox discovering that Bruce had in fact repaired the Bat's autopilot and Gordon finding the repaired Bat-Signal on the roof of the police station. Alfred had no knowledge of either of these things, and their presence makes it clear that Bruce is in fact alive. But the most simple and logical explanation would be that Bruce found out when Alfred would be on holiday, and found the \"cafe by the Arno (River)\" he always visits. He then went there with Selina to make sure that Alfred would see him, alive and well. It is Bruce's way to make Alfred's wish of seeing Bruce alive and happy come true, as Alfred had been such an important person in his life that he deserved this peace of mind."

      "question": "Would people recognize Bruce living in Europe?",
      "answer": "Probably not. Just like most Americans can't name nor recognize any European billionaire, most Europeans won't recognize American billionaires. Assuming Bruce would be recognized is quite silly and Americentric considering only very few American billionaires are famous worldwide. Carmine Falcone even tells Bruce in Batman Begins that he would have to go a thousand miles to find someone who did not know his name. The only man who ever recognized him outside of Gotham was Ra's but that was only because he had already familiarized himself with Gotham. The people Bruce encountered when he traveled the world as a criminal in Batman Begins didn't recognize him. Additionally, in The Dark Knight, when Bruce was in his prime of persona, the by-passers in Hong Kong did not recognize him when he was taking sightseeing pictures with Lucius since no one stopped, looked, and interrupted them. Considering the the vast majority of the American population can't even recognize famous American political figures, it is completely logical that people in Europe wouldn't recognize a billionaire playboy from the United States who was only seen by the public eye twice in a four-year period (and one of the times he deactivated the paparazzi's cameras)."

      "question": "Will John Blake get trained to fight? What persona will he take on at the end of the film?",
      "answer": "When Batman rescues Blake, we see Blake disarm the man about to shoot him and knock him out; so Blake already can fight. Nevertheless. Considering that Bruce left him a bag of goods, we can assume that Bruce left him his future location coordinates in it so Bruce can train him professionally later. Worse-case scenario, Blake could ask Alfred, in who was given half of Wayne Manor, how did Bruce learn to fight and Alfred, having saw Bruce at the cafe with Selina with the pearl necklace, would help locate them for Blake by using the tracking device on it via the Bat computer (similar to how Bruce found Selina in the beginning of the film). Due to this film being the end of the trilogy, viewers can speculate who he will be. The theories are:1. Robin: At the end of the film, Blake reveals that his first name is Robin. Therefore it would stand to reason that Christopher Nolan was hinting that he would become the Superhero named Robin. However this is the least likely out of the scenarios. After all, becoming a superhero with your first name probably isn't the smartest way to keep your identity secret. After all, Bruce Wayne didn't dress up as a giant bat and call himself \"Bruce\". Also, Robin was always Batman's sidekick and different people took on the persona over the years in the comics; Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, Tim Drake, etc.. John Blake basically acts as Batman's sidekick throughout the film and at the end we find out that his name was Robin.2. Nightwing: A likely possibility. Nightwing is the persona Dick Grayson took after he became too old to continue on as Robin and went solo. So when John Blake finds the Batcave, he could alter any gadgets or uniforms to his own specifications to become his own superhero. Moreover, the outfit that Blake is wearing at the end of the film, when he enters the cave, is reminiscent of the Nightwing costume from the comics.3. Batman: Often accepted by fans as Christopher Nolan's most likely intention at the end of the film. Throughout the film, Bruce Wayne explains to Blake about how Batman is a symbol, the mask is simply to protect those he cares about and that Batman could be anybody. We are also shown Gordon's surprise that the Bat Signal had been mysteriously repaired; meaning he'll have use for it. Also, the final shot of the film shows Blake looking at the Batcave and when he stands on the platform hidden in the water, it rises up and then the film ends. This was likely an allusion to the title of the film, The Dark Knight Rises."

There are, of course, rumors of a spinoff about John Blake or Catwoman. Anne Hathaway has said she is open to such a film, but only if Nolan directs it.

However, David S. Goyer, who wrote or co-wrote the stories for all three films in Nolan's Batman trilogy, said in an interview, \"The final scene of The Dark Knight Rises is exactly (the) scene we talked about (when Christopher Nolan and I started the trilogy with Batman Begins). It remained completely unchanged.\" And Nolan himself, in an interview with MTV, said, \"One of the first things I knew about the project is how we were going to end the story.\" The film is also partially based on the series of Batman comics The Dark Knight Returns, in whose finale Batman fakes his own death, and there is even a funeral for Bruce Wayne much like the film."

    {
      "question": "Why would Christopher Nolan want to end this highly successful series he has created?",
      "answer": "Christopher Nolan decided this chapter should end rather than expand the series. As he only makes room for one film at a time, he wasn't sure he wanted to return to direct a third Batman film, as The Dark Knight was immensely successful and critically acclaimed, so expectations for a third film would undoubtedly be extremely high. Nolan himself said he would not direct a third film unless the script could match or top The Dark Knight. Ideas started to come while in production of Inception, and Nolan made the decision to end his Batman legacy as a trilogy, closing all loose ends with a definitive conclusion. Christian Bale has said before that he was willing to return for a fourth Batman film if Nolan came to him with a script, he however rejected an offer from Warner Brothers for a fourth film."

That is something I felt very strongly about in terms of my relationship with Heath and the experience I went through with him on The Dark Knight. I didn't want to, in any way, try and account for a real-life tragedy. That seemed inappropriate to me. We just have a new set of characters and a continuation of Bruce Wayne's story not involving The Joker.(edit: After Heath Ledger death, Christopher Nolan wanted to used archived footage cut from The Dark Knight to use so joker can make a smaller cameo. He then decided against it due to him thinking that if he actually did make a cameo with old footage, it would be disrespectful to Heath Ledger and his family.) Edit"

      "question": "Was there a 4-hour cut of this movie that was recut to under 3 hours before it was released? What was cut out from the original cut?",
      "answer": "No. Christopher Nolan addressed that rumor in an interview for Empire Magazine: No, it's not true at all. You read a lot of crazy things. I don't think I'd want to sit through a four-hour version of this movie! As a writer-director, it's pretty easy for me to be rigorous and precise about the running time of the film...and I think with each film I've told the studio exactly how long it was going to be two years ahead of time. The rumor apparently came from what the editors of MTV's website later described as \"a humorous exaggeration\" in a March, 2012 article on their site; before the article was revised, it referred to a \"four-hour rough cut\" of the movie. The rumor also came from that his brother's rough draft of the script was 400 pages long. However, Christopher made his own 165-page shooting script based on it. And we can assume the rough draft was that long since its based of A Tale of Two Cities—a novel that is around 400 pages long. The rumor is also debunked, because the film's shooting script is relatively the same as what was shown in theaters. In terms of what was cut out of the movie, only redundant dialogue was cut out. In terms of Bane's backstory, only a short scene of Bane training out of Ra's Al Ghul was cut out. Everything else in the script is relatively the same, although the film changed the last fight between Batman and Bane to be slightly longer and different."

He already took the Bat and given the versatility of it, he figured taking another Tumbler was not necessary.3.

      "question": "What were the steps in Bane and Talia's plot?",
      "answer": "Step 1: An undisclosed amount of time before the beginning of the film; Bane starts working with John Daggett, securing fortunes for him in West Africa. This allows Daggett to buy up substantial shares of Wayne Enterprises and get himself a seat on the board of directors.Step 2: Bane and two of his henchmen pretend to be captured by mercenaries lead by Barsad (who was actually one of Bane's men) and handed over to the CIA in order to find out if Dr. Pavel (who was defecting to the USA) has given any information over to them.Step 3: Bane and his men kidnap Dr. Pavel mid-flight and crash the plane transporting them in order to fake Pavel's death, which they do by transferring some of Pavel's blood to a corpse that would be mangled beyond recognition in the crash.Step 4: 6 months later Daggett hires Selina Kyle/Catwoman to obtain Bruce Wayne's fingerprints.Step 5: Bane and his men launch the stock market raid to upload a program with Bruce Wayne's stolen fingerprints, they are able to authorize several bad investments in Bruce's name, causing Bruce to go bankrupt, losing his seat on the board of directors of Wayne Enterprises and also losing him his controlling share of the company.Step 6: Daggett expected this would lead to him having the majority share and in effect place him in charge of Wayne Enterprises. However, Bruce goes to another board member, Miranda Tate, and asks her to take control of the company in order to keep the fusion reactor program safe from the world until it can be fixed.Step 7: At this point, Daggett has out-lived his usefulness and Bane kills him.Step 8: Bane faces off against Batman, revealing that he knows Batman's true identity. Bane reveals his base is set up directly underneath Wayne Enterprises' Research and Development facility, giving Bane and his men full access to all of Batman's weapons, gadgets, and vehicles. Bane continues to brutally beat Batman and eventually defeats him.Step 9: Bane takes the wounded Bruce Wayne to an undisclosed part of the world and places him in a pit prison which Bane describes as \"the worst hell on Earth\". Bane then reveals he will let Bruce live only to torture his soul, by terrorizing Gotham, and feeding the people just enough hope to survive, then he will obliterate them, while forcing Bruce to watch it all from prison.Step 10: Bane crashes a Wayne Enterprises board meeting and takes Lucius Fox, Miranda Tate and Fredericks down to the facility where the fusion reactor is kept and forces them to activate it.Step 11: Bane makes Dr. Pavel turn the fusion reactor into a neutron bomb. Bane removes the core, causing the reactor to become unstable; effectively turning it into a time-bomb with a five-month fuse.Step 12: Daggett´s construction crews have been repairing different parts of the city using some kind of mix between explosives and cement, Bane sets off dozens of explosives around the main island of Gotham, taking out all but one bridge and destroying the football stadium during a game, also trapping thousands of Gotham City cops in underground tunnels. He then reveals to the world the bomb and that Dr. Pavel is the only one capable of diffusing it. Then Bane breaks Pavel's neck on TV and reveals that nobody must resist them or try and escape because an ordinary citizen in the city holds the trigger and will detonate the bomb if anyone tries.Step 13: Bane reads Commissioner Gordon's confession about covering up Harvey Dent's crimes on live television. He then releases the inmates of Blackgate Prison to join his cause.Step 14: Bane effectively takes control of Gotham City, allowing kangaroo courts for loose ends (such as Stryver), the rich, decadent and corrupt. Martial law is put in effect and maintains control for over 4 months. Bane then waits, counting down the time until the bomb goes off.Step 15: Batman returns to stop Bane. It is then revealed that both Bane and Miranda Tate were the masterminds behind the whole plot because Miranda is actually Ra's Al Ghul's daughter, Talia, and wanted vengeance against Bruce Wayne for killing her father and foiling his plan to destroy Gotham. Bane, while excommunicated by Ra's Al Ghul, was a loyal friend and protector to Talia and willingly executed the plan."

It's only him and Alfred living there with no maids regularly working for Wayne Manor.

      "question": "Why didn't Bane leave guards down in The Pit? Could people passing by have freed the prisoners, and who gives them rations?",
      "answer": "Bane is a well-known international terrorist and mercenary who was wanted for his terrorist actions by the CIA; and Alfred tells Bruce about the legends around him being trained by The League of Shadows, a terrorist organization that has been around for centuries. Bruce's Caretaker revealed how The Pit used to be owned by a local warlord, then later we're shown flashbacks to when Ra's al Ghul rescued Bane from there as his men killed the prisoners. This coupled with The Caretaker telling Bruce that \"This is Bane's prison now..\", it's deducable that Bane took over The Pit from the warlord after he rose up in The League of Shadows and uses it to lock up his enemies. People wouldn't want to come near The Pit and free them out of fear of being killed. Some of the prisoners are older and more frail, they wouldn't be able to travel up the pit without extra help and time. Thus Bane doesn't feel the need to have guards to contain them nor Bruce in the middle of the film when the latter has been beaten after 8 years of inactivity as Batman. Bane was arrogant and believed that Bruce wouldn't have the will to escape.As for rations; we're shown a town nearby The Pit as Bruce escapes; so Bane likely had people rope down rations to them on various days. This isn't explained but nothing negates it happening offscreen."

      "question": "Did Commissioner Gordon suffer any repercussions for his role in covering up Harvey Dent's crimes?",
      "answer": "He wouldn't due to his role in aiding Batman and the rest of the surviving GCPD in saving Gotham City from the detonation of the bomb. His role in aiding the cover-up was also reluctant, not malicious, due to him and Batman having no choice since The Joker had already been arrested by the time they reached Harvey Dent's destination. Logically, The Dent Act is undone and it's likely that new laws would be implemented to prevent crime without punishment as severe as denying parole like The Dent Act did."

The DWP man tells him \"bodies wash up a couple times a month at the basin.\" Then, Blake found out the teenager was from his old orphanage and he and other outgrown orphans came to the sewers to find work in the recession.

    {
      "question": "How did Blake know Bruce Wayne is Batman?",
      "answer": "In his first conversation with Bruce, Blake reveals that he was also an orphan who watched his father's murder and that he understands what that does to a kid, how he, like Bruce, was trapped in his anger. He told Bruce, \"You gotta learn to hide the anger-practice smiling in the mirror-It's like putting on a mask.\" Blake recounts a visit Bruce made to the orphanage where Blake grew up. Blake tells Bruce, \"We were so excited. Bruce Wayne-billionaire orphan! I mean, we used to make up stories about you, man. Legends. And to the other kids, you know, it was all that was-just stories, but. . .\" So, since he was \"Bruce Wayne, billionaire orphan\", the awed orphans thought Bruce was Batman and made up stories and legends about it (i.e. Bruce Wayne is Batman because he is rich, Bruce Wayne is Batman because he is out to avenge his parents, etc.) The orphans liked Batman, since they are, after all, kids-shown by the orphan Blake talks to who draws bat symbols. But to the other kids, Bruce's happy-go-lucky persona did not fit Batman's angry nature-thus, the idea that Bruce is Batman was only just a story to them. But, when Blake saw Bruce's face, he saw it as more than a story. The moment Blake laid eyes on Billionaire Bruce stepping out of a fancy car with a supermodel on his arm: \"Right when I saw you, I knew who you really were. I'd seen that look on your face before. It's the same one I learned myself.\" Blake knows that the \"eccentric billionaire\" is a mask that hides Bruce's true angry nature, making the stories true."

      "question": "How come the illegitimate transaction wasn't overturned?",
      "answer": "The transaction would have been overturned, since Fox told Bruce the following day, \"In the Long term we may be able to prove fraud, but for now; you're completely broke.\" But, Bane took Bruce out of Gotham before then. With a missing Bruce and a city held hostage, there would be no point in reversing the transaction. Plus, according to Lucius in his Manor visit, the program Bane and his men had assigned to Bruce put options and the options expired last night, making the newspaper read, \"Wayne Doubles Down and Loses\". Because put option investments are in nature many months in retrospect, the program would only work by creating a false paper trail that lead back months. So even if any and all transactions on the day Bane attacked the exchange were voided, nobody would be the wiser to the fact that the fraudulent reports actually went back much longer than the day in question, thus creating a mess that must be investigated before fixing. Besides, Bane didn't need the plan to work long-term-only a couple of days to ensure that Miranda Tate was given control of Wayne Enterprises.Additionally, even if a terrorist bankrupting a person by stock exchange may not realistically get away with it, the other Nolan Batman films have similar controversial events; so this is all part of the trilogy's overall comic-book fantasy, whether people like it or not."

      "question": "How did Bruce heal his back in five months? Is his leg healed too?",
      "answer": "Bruce Wayne's back was dislocated, not broken, in his first fight with Bane. This is confirmed when Bruce's caretaker told him, *\"You have a protruding vertebrae...I'm going to force it back...\" *Aligning vertebrae heal fast since no bones were broken. Only spinal ligament muscles torn-although ligaments take over a year to fully heal, a few months of healing is enough to stabilize the back. Even if his vertebrae were broken, vertebrae take up to three months to heal, so the time frame would be fine regardless.Bruce's leg may or may not have the brace still on since we never see him without the trousers in the Pit. We are to assume Bane left it on, since he thought Bruce couldn't escape. Nevertheless, if Bruce didn't have it, then he walked with the pain. No cartilage in the knee means he has osteoarthritis in the knee and that causes painful, stiff joints-not inability to walk); Bruce in the beginning of the film was still able to jump out of the hospital room in one scene and dance with Selina in another before the scene when he got the knee brace. Things like canes and knee braces help put weight off the knee to make walking less painful."

      "question": "Was Bane actually born in the prison?",
      "answer": "In the comics, Bane was in fact born in a prison and spent the first part of his life there, forced to serve out his father's prison sentence by a cruel dictator who had decided to punish the family. In the movie, Alfred says rumors say \"there is a prison in a more ancient part of the world. A pit. But sometimes a man rises from the darkness\" and that Bane was \"born and raised in hell on earth. No one knows why or how he escaped\". Later, Bane gives a speech to Batman about being born in darkness and not seeing the light until he was a man. Then, in the pit, he tells Bruce when the latter asks \"where am I\" that they are \"home.\" Finally, a long time ago in the pit, Bruce's caretaker said Bane protected the child Talia since he wanted to \"show the others that (the child's) innocence was their redemption\". That logic only works if Bane himself was born in the pit and felt sympathy for another innocent person being born there. All in all, we can deduce Bane really was born in the pit."

      "question": "How does Bane seem to be one step ahead of everyone?",

For example, when the Special Forces team manages to infiltrate the city, Blake takes them to where Lucius, Miranda and others are hiding. Bane shows up and kills the Special Forces team, having heard the news from Talia."

    {
      "question": "How did Bane transport Bruce to the pit prison so quickly, and how did Bruce get back to Gotham?",
      "answer": "Alfred mentions to Bruce early in the film that the pit is in \"some more ancient part of the world.\" The filmed fort is in Jodhpur, India, but the film's \"deshi basara\" chant is in Moroccan Arabic, so we can assume the pit is in Morocco. Thus, the pit is only an ocean away from the U.S. Bane also has a cargo plane since he used it to attack the CIA plane in the beginning of the film; Miranda/Talia also has a plane, when she says to Bruce: \"We could leave. Tonight. Take my plane. Go anywhere we wanted\"; Bane would have used either to transport Bruce.Concerning how much time Bruce had to get back to the U.S. from the pit, Lucius tells the Special Forces that \"the bomb\" will go off. In twenty-three days.\" A couple scenes later, Bruce escapes the Pit. When Bruce gets back to Gotham, he tells Selina \"the bomb goes off tomorrow.\" Thus, we can assume Bruce had 3 weeks to get back to Gotham, which is plenty of time. The film does not visually show how Bruce got back to Gotham, because it is already established Bruce already had these skills from Batman Begins. The Dark Knight Rises has two mise-en-scene allusions to this previous film to remind the audience of this: Bruce wearing rough clothing with a makeshift travel bag on the tough terrain after leaving the pit alludes to Bruce traveling the Tibetan mountains in Batman Begins. Selina sharing an apple with the orphan before Bruce returns alludes to the Batman Begins scene when Bruce shared an apple with a boy in sub-Saharan Africa. In Batman Begins, Bruce traveled the world for 7 years in poverty and no other resources-sneaking and stealing his way by-to understand the minds of criminals. Then, when he was trained by the League of Shadows, he mastered the use of theatricality, \"invisibility\", and other ninja skills. It is obvious Bruce could have just gotten back to the U.S. by sneaking in a plane or boat, faking a passport, etc. (Also, although Bruce got back to the U.S. through a private jet in Batman Begins, the same film shows him burning his wallet, giving his coat to a hobo, and then sneaking into a boat by the Gotham port to leave the U.S. So, he has the ability to do transatlantic travel all by himself.)In terms of getting into Gotham, Gotham wasn't technically quarantined, as food shipments were allowed in. Citizens just weren't allowed out. The film itself establishes a direct explanation for getting onto the island-the Special Forces being undercover as men delivering supplies. It proves that other people were also successfully sneaking into the city during Occupied Gotham. Nevertheless, there are three ways suggested in the film. (1) Bruce sneaked in the same way as the Special Forces did through the shipments. (2) he walked on ice to Gotham with \"sure-footing\" as shown in his training with Ra's al Ghul in the first film, Batman Begins. This is actually confirmed in The Dark Knight Rises when Batman meets Gordon halfway along the ice, walking effortlessly towards him. (3) He used the Bat to get on the islands since it was last parked in the Bat-cave when Bruce left Gotham and then seen draped over on a rooftop in the island when he returned. Wayne Manor is outside Gotham's islands (and on the U.S. mainland). In The Dark Knight, Harvey wondered if the manor is within city limits and Bruce said it is in the Palisades, which is considered within the city by jurisdiction. Harvey asked this probably since the Palisades is not in the islands of Gotham. In the Gotham map that appeared in the film's viral marketing online game The Fire Rises (not to be confused with the the strike-zone Gotham map in another viral marketing site), the manor and Palisades is outside the islands and on the mainland. This fact is important since we saw, in the film, Bane blow up the bridges connecting the islands with the mainland. At the end of the film, nothing suggests that Wayne Manor was looted or attacked by Bane's men or criminals."

      "question": "How did Bruce survive the rope falls in the Pit? What about him surviving the knife stab in the judicial hall?",
      "answer": "The force of falling with the rope probably was enough to injure him significantly. The reason being is questionable falls like this is in the overall Dark Knight trilogy logic, whether people like it or not. For example, The Dark Knight, Joker and his 2 men somehow survived the 18-wheeler flip despite the ridiculous amount of g-force from 40 tons of truck weight and it going at full speed. Likewise, Batman and Rachel somehow survived the multistory penthouse fall even though they crushed the car roof and we see it cave in (so the cape barely broke the fall) and Batman landed on his back.For the knife stab, the stab wound was probably not fatal-rather to incapacitate Batman long enough so the bomb would go off. Batman was stabbed between the rib by the liver area, in which stab wounds, including liver wounds, are known to be non-fatal if no major artery is hit. That waist/liver area's only major artery is the hepatic artery and that is far deep in the center of the body and not that reachable by knife. Considering Talia told Bane not to shoot him after she stabbed him, because she wanted Batman to live and \"Feel the fire of twelve million souls (he) failed\", we can assume it isn't fatal. Nevertheless, in The Dark Knight, along with a crow bar in his left hand, we see a knife in Joker's right hand and he stabbed Batman multiple times in their final fight and Batman survived. Thus, we can assume that Talia's stabbing isn't a big deal."
