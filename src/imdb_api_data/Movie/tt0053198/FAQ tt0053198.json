      "question": "Why is the movie named \"The 400 Blows\"?",
      "answer": "The English title of the movie \"400 Blows\" is a gross misinterpretation of the original title. The Finnish and Swedish translations of the title, roughly translatable to \"400 practical jokes\" are closer to the original meaning, albeit not perfect. The Swedish title: \"De 400 slagen\" means \"The 400 blows\" and make no sense. The original title stems from the French expression \"Faire les quatre cents coups\", meaning \"to live a wild life\", as the main character does. Literal translation of the expression would be \"to do the 400 dirty tricks"
