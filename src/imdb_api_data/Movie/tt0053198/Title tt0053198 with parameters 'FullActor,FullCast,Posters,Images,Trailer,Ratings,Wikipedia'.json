It ranked 13th in the directors' poll on the same list.\r\nPlot\r\nAntoine Doinel is a young boy growing up in Paris. Misunderstood by his parents for playing truant from school and stealing and tormented in school for discipline problems by his teacher (such as writing on the classroom wall, and later falsely explaining his absence as having been due to his mother's death), Antoine frequently runs away from both places. He finally quits school after his teacher accuses him of plagiarizing Balzac. (Antoine loves Balzac and in a school essay he describes \"the death of my grandfather\", in a close paraphrase of Balzac from memory.)

      "html": "<p>The 400 Blows (French: Les Quatre Cents Coups) is a 1959 French coming-of-age drama film, and the directorial debut of François Truffaut. The film, shot in DyaliScope, stars Jean-Pierre Léaud, Albert Rémy, and Claire Maurier. One of the defining films of the French New Wave, it displays many of the characteristic traits of the movement. Written by Truffaut and Marcel Moussy, the film is about Antoine Doinel, a misunderstood adolescent in Paris who struggles with his parents and teachers due to his rebellious behavior. Filmed on location in Paris and Honfleur, it is the first in a series of five films in which Léaud plays the semi-autobiographical character.</p><p>The 400 Blows received numerous awards and nominations, including the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director, the OCIC Award, and a Palme d'Or nomination in 1959, and was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 1960. The film had 4.1 million admissions in France, making it Truffaut's most successful film in his home country.</p><p>The 400 Blows is widely considered one of the best French films in the history of cinema; in the 2012 Sight & Sound critics' poll of the greatest films ever made, it was ranked 39th. It ranked 13th in the directors' poll on the same list.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Antoine Doinel is a young boy growing up in Paris. Misunderstood by his parents for playing truant from school and stealing and tormented in school for discipline problems by his teacher (such as writing on the classroom wall, and later falsely explaining his absence as having been due to his mother's death), Antoine frequently runs away from both places. He finally quits school after his teacher accuses him of plagiarizing Balzac. (Antoine loves Balzac and in a school essay he describes \"the death of my grandfather\", in a close paraphrase of Balzac from memory.) He steals a Royal typewriter from his stepfather's workplace to finance his plans to leave home, but, having been unable to sell it, is apprehended while trying to return it.</p><p>The stepfather turns Antoine over to the police and Antoine spends the night in jail, sharing a cell with prostitutes and thieves. During an interview with the judge, Antoine's mother confesses that her husband is not Antoine's biological father. Antoine is placed in an observation center for troubled youths near the seashore (as his mother wished). A psychologist at the center probes reasons for Antoine's unhappiness, which the youth reveals in a fragmented series of monologues.</p><p>While playing football with the other boys one day, Antoine escapes under a fence and runs away to the ocean, which he has always wanted to see. He reaches the shoreline of the sea and runs into it. The film concludes with a freeze-frame of Antoine, which, via an optical effect, zooms in on his face as he looks into the camera.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Jean-Pierre Léaud as Antoine Doinel</li><li>Albert Rémy as Julien Doinel, Antoine's stepfather</li><li>Claire Maurier as Gilberte Doinel, Antoine's mother</li><li>Guy Decomble as Sourpuss, schoolteacher</li><li>Patrick Auffay as René Bigey, Antoine's best friend</li><li>Georges Flamant as Monsieur Bigey, René's father</li><li>Pierre Repp as an English teacher</li><li>Daniel Couturier as Betrand Mauricet</li><li>Luc Andrieux as Le professeur de gym</li><li>Robert Beauvais as director of the school</li><li>Yvonne Claudie as Mme Bigey</li><li>Marius Laurey as L'inspecteur Cabanel</li><li>Claude Mansard as the examining magistrate</li><li>Jacques Monod as commissioner</li><li>Henri Virlojeux as the night watchman</li><li>Jeanne Moreau as a woman looking for her dog</li><li>Jean-Claude Brialy as a man trying to pick up a woman</li></ul><p>Truffaut also included a number of friends (fellow directors) in bit or background parts, including himself and Philippe De Broca in the funfair scene; Jacques Demy as a policeman; Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Paul Belmondo as overheard voices (Belmondo's in the print works scene).</p><br/><h3>Production</h3><h4>Title</h4><p>The English title is a literal translation of the French that fails to capture its meaning, as the French title refers to the idiom \"faire les quatre cents coups\", meaning \"to raise hell\".
