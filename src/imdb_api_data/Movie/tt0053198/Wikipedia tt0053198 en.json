It ranked 13th in the directors' poll on the same list.\r\nPlot\r\nAntoine Doinel is a young boy growing up in Paris. Misunderstood by his parents for playing truant from school and stealing and tormented in school for discipline problems by his teacher (such as writing on the classroom wall, and later falsely explaining his absence as having been due to his mother's death), Antoine frequently runs away from both places. He finally quits school after his teacher accuses him of plagiarizing Balzac. (Antoine loves Balzac and in a school essay he describes \"the death of my grandfather\", in a close paraphrase of Balzac from memory.) He steals a Royal typewriter from his stepfather's workplace to finance his plans to leave home, but, having been unable to sell it, is apprehended while trying to return it.\r\nThe stepfather turns Antoine over to the police and Antoine spends the night in jail, sharing a cell with prostitutes and thieves. During an interview with the judge, Antoine's mother confesses that her husband is not Antoine's biological father. Antoine is placed in an observation center for troubled youths near the seashore (as his mother wished). A psychologist at the center probes reasons for Antoine's unhappiness, which the youth reveals in a fragmented series of monologues.\r\nWhile playing football with the other boys one day, Antoine escapes under a fence and runs away to the ocean, which he has always wanted to see. He reaches the shoreline of the sea and runs into it. The film concludes with a freeze-frame of Antoine, which, via an optical effect, zooms in on his face as he looks into the camera.\r\nCast\r\nJean-Pierre Léaud as Antoine Doinel\r\nAlbert Rémy as Julien Doinel, Antoine's stepfather\r\nClaire Maurier as Gilberte Doinel, Antoine's mother\r\nGuy Decomble as Sourpuss, schoolteacher\r\nPatrick Auffay as René Bigey, Antoine's best friend\r\nGeorges Flamant as Monsieur Bigey, René's father\r\nPierre Repp as an English teacher\r\nDaniel Couturier as Betrand Mauricet\r\nLuc Andrieux as Le professeur de gym\r\nRobert Beauvais as director of the school\r\nYvonne Claudie as Mme Bigey\r\nMarius Laurey as L'inspecteur Cabanel\r\nClaude Mansard as the examining magistrate\r\nJacques Monod as commissioner\r\nHenri Virlojeux as the night watchman\r\nJeanne Moreau as a woman looking for her dog\r\nJean-Claude Brialy as a man trying to pick up a woman\r\nTruffaut also included a number of friends (fellow directors) in bit or background parts, including himself and Philippe De Broca in the funfair scene; Jacques Demy as a policeman; Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Paul Belmondo as overheard voices (Belmondo's in the print works scene).\r\nProduction\r\nTitle\r\nThe English title is a literal translation of the French that fails to capture its meaning, as the French title refers to the idiom \"faire les quatre cents coups\", meaning \"to raise hell\". On the first prints in the United States, subtitler and dubber Noelle Gillmor translated the title as Wild Oats, but the distributor Zenith did not like that and reverted it to The 400 Blows.\r\nThemes\r\nThe semi-autobiographical film reflects events of Truffaut's life. In style, it references other French works—most notably a scene borrowed wholesale from Jean Vigo's Zéro de conduite. Truffaut dedicated the film to the man who became his spiritual father, André Bazin, who died just as the film was about to be shot.\r\nBesides being a character study, the film is an exposé of the injustices of the treatment of juvenile offenders in France at the time.\r\nAccording to Annette Insdorf writing for the Criterion Collection, the film is \"rooted in Truffaut’s childhood.\" This includes how both Antoine and Truffaut \"found a substitute home in the movie theater\" and both did not know their biological fathers.\r\nFilming locations\r\nMost of The 400 Blows was filmed in Paris:\r\nAvenue Frochot, Paris 9th\r\nEiffel Tower, Champ de Mars, Paris 7th\r\nMontmartre, Paris 18th\r\nPalais de Chaillot, Trocadéro, Paris 16th\r\nPigalle, Paris 9th\r\nRue Fontaine\r\nSacré Cœur, Paris 18th\r\nThe exception was for scenes filmed at the reform school, which were filmed in Honfleur, a small coastal town in the northern French province of Normandy.\r\nReception\r\nThe film opened the 1959 Cannes Film Festival and was widely acclaimed, winning numerous awards, including the Best Director Award at Cannes, the Critics Award of the 1959 New York Film Critics' Circle and the Best European Film Award at 1960's Bodil Awards. It was nominated for Best Original Screenplay at the 32nd Academy Awards. The film holds a 99% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 71 reviews, with a weighted average of 9.4/10. The website's critical consensus states, \"A seminal French New Wave film that offers an honest, sympathetic, and wholly heartbreaking observation of adolescence without trite nostalgia.\"\r\nThe film is among the top 10 of the British Film Institute's list of 50 films that should be seen by age 15.\r\nAwards and nominations\r\nLegacy\r\nTruffaut made four other films with Léaud depicting Antoine at later stages of his life: Antoine and Colette (which was Truffaut's contribution to the 1962 anthology Love at Twenty), Stolen Kisses, Bed and Board, and Love on the Run.\r\nFilmmakers Akira Kurosawa, Luis Buñuel, Satyajit Ray, Steven Spielberg, Jean Cocteau, Carl Theodor Dreyer, Richard Linklater, Tsai Ming Liang, Woody Allen, Richard Lester, P C Sreeram, Norman Jewison, Wes Anderson and Nicolas Cage have cited The 400 Blows as one of their favorite movies. Kurosawa called it \"one of the most beautiful films that I have ever seen\".\r\nMartin Scorsese included it on a list of \"39 Essential Foreign Films for a Young Filmmaker.\"\r\nThe film was ranked #29 in Empire magazine's list of \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010. In 2018, the film was voted the eighth greatest foreign-language film of all time in BBC's poll of 209 critics in 43 countries.\r\nThe festival poster for the 71st Venice International Film Festival paid tribute to the film as it featured the character of Antoine Doinel portrayed by Jean-Pierre Léaud.",
