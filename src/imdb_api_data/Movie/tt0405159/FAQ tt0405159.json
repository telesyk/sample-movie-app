      "question": "What is 'Million Dollar Baby' about?",
      "answer": "More than anything in life, Mary Margaret \"Maggie\" Fitzgerald (), a 31-year-old waitress from a poor, dysfunctional family in Missouri, wants to be a boxer. With no training and little money but a lot of determination, she hits upon aging trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to show her the ropes. At first, Frankie is unwilling (\"I don't train girls\"), but Maggie persists until Frankie agrees to show her a few tips and finally consents to be her trainer. In doing so, Frankie (who has been estranged from his own daughter) and Maggie (whose father died when she was young) begin to fill voids in each others' lives. Aided by his best friend, one-eyed ex-boxer Eddie \"Scrap-iron\" Dupris (Morgan Freeman) (who also narrates the story), Frankie lifts Maggie from a scrapper to where she is ready to take on the World Boxing Association (WBA) women's welterweight champion, Billie \"The Blue Bear\" (Lucia Rijker), an East German with a reputation as a dirty fighter.

      "question": "What is C1 and C2?",
      "answer": "\"C1\" and \"C2\" refer to respectively the first and second (of seven) cervical vertebrae comprising the spinal column (backbone) through which the spinal cord passes. The cervical spine begins at the base of the skull and is followed by 12 thoracic vertebrae, five lumbar vertebrae, five sacral vertebrae, and the coccyx (tailbone). (See diagram.) Nerves extending from the spinal column control many of the bodily functions, such as head and neck control, arm and leg control, and many vital organs, such as the diaphragm, bladder, etc. A break in the C1 or C2 area can leave a person quadriplegic and unable to breathe on their own."

      "question": "What does Mo Chúisle mean?",
      "answer": "Near the end of the movie, Frankie finally tells Maggie that Mo chúisle (pronounced \"mo cush-lah\") translates from the Irish Gaelic as \"My darling, my blood.\" It's a term of endearment and literally means \"my pulse\"."

      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "Maggie begins to develop bed sores on her arms and legs. When the doctors amputate one of her legs, she asks Frankie to do for her what her daddy did for her dog Axel. Frankie refuses, so she bites off her own tongue and nearly bleeds to death before the doctors can get it sewed up. After speaking with Father Jorvak (), with Scrap, and with his own conscience, Frankie sneaks into the hospital late at night, unhitches Maggie's respirator, and euthanizes her with a large injection of adrenalin into her IV. It is then revealed that the story, which has been narrated by Scrap since the beginning, is actually a letter to Frankie's daughter. He ends the letter with the following: I went back to the gym and waited, figuring he'd turn up sooner or later [shots of Scrap sitting alone at the gym] and that's when a ghost came through the door [shot of Danger (Jay Baruchel) returning to the gym]. Frankie never came back at all. Frankie didn't leave a note and nobody knew where he went. I'd hope he'd gone to find you and ask you one more time to forgive him, but maybe he didn't have anything left in his heart. I just hope he went someplace where he could find a little peace, a place set in the cedars and oak trees, somewhere between nowhere and goodbye [shot of Ida's Diner], but that's probably wishful thinking. No matter where he is, I thought you should know what kind of man your father really was. In the final scene, the camera pans through the window of Ida's diner, showing Frankie seated at the counter, possibly eating a piece of homemade lemon meringue pie. Edit"

    {
      "question": "What happened to Frankie after he disappeared?",
      "answer": "No one knows, not even Scrap. There is the strong suggestion that Frankie may have made good on his idea of buying Ida's Roadside Diner and retiring there. Other possibilities proffered are that he (1) was arrested and sent to jail, (2) packed up and disappeared, leaving no trail, or (3) committed suicide using the second syringe in his bag."

      "answer": "It would seem that his love for boxing over shadowed his responsibilities of being a husband and a father.Morgan Freeman's entire narration of the movie. Is a letter that he is writing to Frankie's daughter in the final scene. Explaining the reasons why her father was never around and the man that he really was."
