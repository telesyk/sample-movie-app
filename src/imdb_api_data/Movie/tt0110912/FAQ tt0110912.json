      "question": "Why is Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) the only one on the poster ?",
      "answer": "Because the \"pulp fiction\" paperback books the movie is patterned after typically featured a sexy woman on the cover. The prominent position of the gun alerts the reader that there will be plenty of violence as well."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Jules call Pumpkin \"Ringo\"?",
      "answer": "Because Pumpkin is British. Jules calls him \"Ringo\" in reference to Ringo Starr. The drummer for British band, the Beatles. This as well as Mia Wallace's comment \"An Elvis man should love this\" is a reference to a deleted scene (included in some edited for television versions) where Mia claims that everyone can be classified as either an \"Elvis\" (Elvis Presley) person or a \"Beatles\" (The Beatles) person. She bets Vincent that he is an \"Elvis\", and he confirms it. Tarantino says he removed the scene because of the film cliché of having one character film another with a handheld camera."

      "question": "Why did Paul the bartender and Jules laugh when they asked Vincent about his taking Mia out? They laughed just after they asked him if he'd met her and he said no.",
      "answer": "Vincent obviously did not realise how gorgeous Mia was. Neither man believed Vincent would not make a move on her."

    {
      "question": "Why was Vincent in Amsterdam for so long? Just a change of scenery or maybe had to get out of the country for legal reasons?",
      "answer": "Vincent was in Amsterdam for three years. So he likely was there as a go-between for Marsellus."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is 'Pulp Fiction' based on a book?",
      "answer": "The screenplay for Pulp Fiction was co-written by director Quentin Tarantino and Canadian-born screenwriter, Roger Avary. It was also published on paperback as a tie-in to the film, but it is written just for the film itself."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is in the briefcase?",
      "answer": "According to Quentin Tarantino, \"It's whatever the viewer wants it to be.\" The popular term for a plot device in which the details are unknown, e.g., what's in the suitcase, what's the secret formula for, why the birds suddenly started to attack humans, etc., is called a MacGuffin. Some viewers have suggested that the briefcase contains: Marsellus Wallace's soul, Marvin Nash's ear, the stolen diamonds from , OJ's or Michael Jackson's other glove, the Oscar that Tarantino hopes to win, Judy Davis' head from Barton Fink (1991) , laundered money, gold bullion, Marsellus's dirty laundry, or a 25-watt transparent amber light bulb, which is the prop used to create the effect. In other words, it could be anything. It has been declared that the content was originally meant to be diamonds, but Tarantino felt it would have been too dull. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Quentin Tarantino have a cameo?",
      "answer": "Yes, more of a minor role than a cameo. He plays Jimmy Dimmick, the guy who helps Jules and Vincent out after Vince shot Marvin. He loans them his garage until they can figure out a way out of their predicament. Tarantino had originally intended to play Lance, the guy who deals heroin to Vincent, but he switched roles because he wanted to direct the scene with the adrenaline shot."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is what Yolanda says in the beginning different from what she says at the end?",
      "answer": "Tarantino has explained that this is not an error, rather, he did this on purpose. When we first examine the scene, we are seeing Ringo and Yolanda's conversation from their perspective. Because this is their conversation, what we hear first is probably what was actually said. However, at the end of the film, what is said is different because we are no longer viewing the situation from Ringo and Yolanda's perspective, but rather everyone else in the diner, most specifically Jules."
    },
    {
      "question": "What book is Vincent reading?",
      "answer": "The book is the first Modesty Blaise novel, which tracks the adventures of female spy Modesty Blaise. Though not of general reference to anything in the movie, it could be noted that Modesty is of some comparable significance to Mia's earlier mentions of \"Fox Force Five,\" a show about a group of female spies. The edition Vincent reads has a mock-up cover that Tarantino had his prop department make, based upon the cover of an early edition of the novel."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the Wolf mean when he tells Jules & Vincent, \"...you've both been in county before, I'm sure; here it comes!\", before he opens up with the hose?",
      "answer": "He's teasing them about being arrested and put into county lockup, i.e. jail. As they are career criminals, it's a safe bet they've been arrested at some point in the past, probably more than once. In county lockup, accused criminals are \"processed\" before standing trial which means that they're given an opportunity to get cleaned up to be more presentable for court. So, depending on the county in which the defendants are locked up, they might be sprayed with a hose by the staff after having been stripped down, or otherwise instead of being treated like animals, they might get a chance to take a shower with cold water. Also, short incarceration sentences are typically served often served in jails, and the admission procedures may be similar to those of penitentiaries. Winston was giving Jules and Vincent both a hard time about their past experience—and given his joking nature, probably enjoying it."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the deal with the guy in black?",
      "answer": "That's \"The Gimp,\" an extreme sexual submissive who is apparently kept prisoner in Maynard and Zed's basement. The character was Roger Avary's idea, who was inspired by (1972). Unfortunately, nothing is specified about the character's origin or the circumstances of his time in the basement, except that he has no apparent desire to be freed. Another character named \"Russell\" once inhabited the same room. The screenplay implies that Russell was a previous prisoner whom Maynard and Zed eventually killed. The text commentary on the Pulp Fiction Special Edition DVD is similarly vague. It only refers to the Gimp a few times, and calls Butch the \"victim of violence\" and the Gimp the \"perpetrator of violence.\" Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Marsellus have a Band-Aid on the back of his neck?",
      "answer": "One theory is that it was covering the hole where the \"devil's helpers,\" Brett and gang, stole Marsellus's soul, a longstanding interpretation of the film that has made its rounds among fans since the film was released. However, there is a more mundane explanation. Ving Rhames just happened to have a real-life cut. There is a large scar visible on the back of Ving Rhames' head in all of his later films exactly where the band-aid was. It was possible that he recently had surgery in that area, and instead of covering it with make-up or showing it to the viewing audience (thus confusing them, as it wouldn't have been in the script and therefore never explained), they decided to just cover it with a band-aid. Another theory is that Ving Rhames may have cut himself severely when he was shaving his head."

    {
      "question": "Are \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Reservoir Dogs\" connected?",
      "answer": "Yes, and in several ways: (1) Vincent from Pulp Fiction and Vic \"Mr. Blonde\" Vega () from [title=tt0105236] are brothers. For a time Quentin Tarantino wanted to do a film with them as main characters. He has since dropped the project; (2) Jimmie Dimmick from \"Pulp Fiction\" and Larry \"Mr. White\" Dimmick are supposed to be related in some fashion; (3) Steven Buscemi is seen as a waiter, when in \"Reservoir Dog\"s, his character makes a passing reference that he worked minimal wage and that he refuses to tip waiters; (4) The fictional restaurant Big Kahuna Burger is featured in both films; (5) Originally the contents of the briefcase were to be the diamonds from Reservoir Dogs, but Tarantino found that to be too lackluster; (6) In a deleted scene from \"Reservoir Dogs\", Mr. Pink, Mr. White and Nice-Guy Eddie are speaking about taking Mr. Orange to a nurse named Bonnie. In Pulp Fiction, Jimmie Dimmick's wife was a nurse named Bonnie. Nice-Guy Eddie also refers to Bonnie as \"The Bonnie Situation,\" which is a chapter title from \"Pulp Fiction\"; (7) Some also assume that the story revolving around Jules and Vincent in \"Pulp Fiction\" takes place on the same day the events of \"Reservoir Dogs\" take place, which would explain the lack of cops in the street; (8) The woman in her car in \"Reservoir Dogs\" is the same woman that is accidentally shot by Marcellus Wallace in \"Pulp Fiction\". Her name is Linda Kaye; and (9) While The Wolf is at Jimmy's home on the phone he is commenting about a green Chevy Nova, where Mr. Orange, White and Brown crashed. Edit"

      "question": "What is the connection between \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Jackie Brown\"?",
      "answer": "In both films, someone says, \"Garçon means boy.\" The suit that Jackie wears in the film is identical to Mia's in Pulp Fiction. Jackie drives the same model Honda that Butch drove when going to retrieve his watch."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the sword at Maynard's pawn shop the same one as the Bride's in \"Kill Bill\"?",
      "answer": "No. This cannot be the Bride's sword, as hers was custom made by Hattori Hanzo in . Some fans believe that the sword in the Pulp Fiction pawn shop is Budd's, as Budd tells Bill early in Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) that he pawned the sword that Bill had given him. However, it is later shown that Budd was lying, as the Bride discovers Budd's sword hidden in a golf bag during her battle with Elle. Therefore, the sword is neither The Bride's nor Budd's. It is simply a sword that happened to be at the pawn shop. Edit"

    {
      "question": "Were Vince and Mia smoking hashish at Jackrabbit Slim's?",
      "answer": "No. At the beginning when Vince and Jules were talking about \"hash bars,\" Vince was talking about his trip to Amsterdam, not anywhere in Los Angeles. When Mia asked Vince to \"roll one of those for me,\" it's simply because Vince rolls his own cigarettes, a mainstay of tough guys in gangster films. Vincent confirms that it's only tobacco."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was Fabienne pregnant?",
      "answer": "It's never explicitly stated, but it is strongly implied that she was: she had talked about looking at herself in the mirror, picturing herself with a potbelly and how good she would look with it. After having a shower, Fabienne goes to tell Butch something but sees that he is fast asleep and says \"never mind.\" The next morning she talks about having a very large and unusual breakfast, which is uncommon for a woman so petite who isn't pregnant. Fabienne also forgets the watch and can't remember whether she packed it or not, which alludes to her having 'baby brain'."
    },
    {
      "question": "What Tarantino characters are related?",
      "answer": "Vincent Vega (Pulp Fiction) and Victor Vega (Reservoir Dogs) are brothers.Laurence Dimmick a.k.a. Mr. White (Reservoir Dogs) and Jimmy Dimmick (Pulp Fiction) may be related somehow.Jack Scagnetti (Natural Born Killers) and Seymour Scagnetti (mentioned in Reservoir Dogs) could be related.Drexl Spivey (True Romance) and Marsellus Spivey (mentioned in Reservoir Dogs) could be related.Earl McGraw (From Kill Bill Vol. 1, Grindhouse) and Edgar McGraw (Kill Bill Vol. 1, Grindhouse) are father and son. It is also possible that Michael Parks' character is related to the McGraws because Earl McGraw and Ambrose Pierce were both played by the same actor.Bill and Budd are brothers.Sgt. Donny Donowitz (Inglourious Basterds) and Lee Donowitz (True Romance) might be father and son or Uncle and Nephew.When Mr. White and Joe Cabot are talking in a flashback Joe Cabot mentions that Mr. White worked with a women called Alabama which could be Alabama Whitman (True Romance).Oswaldo Mobray (The Hateful Eight), real name \"English\" Pete Hicox, is great-great grandfather to Lt. Archie Hicox (Inglourious Basterds).Note that some names of the characters somewhat correspond with the \"career choice\" of the other, an example being that Drexl is a pimp and Marsellus was a diamond fence who was doing 20 years in prison. Jack Scagnetti was a popular detective and Seymour was a parole officer, etc."

      "question": "Was \"Flock Of Seagulls\" killed by Jules?",
      "answer": "Yes. Jules and Vincent were there to get the briefcase and kill the group for betraying Marcellus, so they killed everyone except Marvin, who was with them (as evidenced when Vincent asks how many guys were up there, he says 'including our guy?'.After the shot is fired, you see Flock of Seagulls roll over slightly, then roll back. Watch his arm when he rolls back. It goes limp and falls toward the floor. Jules is an experienced hit man, and when he positioned himself he instantly knew what angle he needed to make a fatal shot. Add to that the fact that F.O.S. was lying on the couch which made him a very easy target for a fatal shot.Even if he didn't kill him with the one shot we saw, it's entirely possible that he shot him again just before leaving and it simply wasn't shown. So yes, Jules did kill him."

      "question": "When Vincent asks Mia not to tell Marcellus about her overdose, she states that if he were to find out, she'd be in as much trouble as he was. Why would she be in trouble with her husband who's a crime lord?",
      "answer": "It's entirely possible Marsellus doesn't approve of Mia's drug use. We know Marsellus is a criminal, but he's not necessarily a drug dealer. And even if he was, there's the old adage \"don't get high on your own supply.\""

      "question": "When Jules and Vincent need to get the bloody car off the road Jules says he's calling his partner in Toluca Lake, who we later find out is Jimmy. What are they partners in? Jimmy doesn't look or act like the gangster type.",
      "answer": "There are three obvious possibilities here:1) Jimmy was a former gangster whose wife was either unaware of or didn't approve of his being involved in organized crime, resulting in his going straight.2) Jimmy is a businessman with a legit business that Jules has invested in, possibly for money laundering purposes. Making Jules a partner.3) Jimmy is more of a white collar crook. Running scams and laundering money, etc. He's not used to seeing blood-soaked cars with dead bodies in them."

    {
      "question": "Did Vincent Vega & Butch recognize each other in Butch's apartment?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What is the chronological order of the story?",
      "answer": "The chronological order would be: (1) Captain Koons' speech to Butch (2) Vincent & Jules (scene following opening credits), (3) The Bonnie Situation, (4) The Diner Part 1 (opening scene), (5) The Diner Part 2 (ending scene), (6) Vincent Vega & Marcellus Wallace's Wife, and (7) The Gold Watch. These scenes are arranged in a pattern so that the beginnings and ends of two outer stories are sandwiched around two inner stories. Thus: Story A1: The Diner Part 1. Story B1: Vincent & Jules. Story C: Vincent & Mia (& Lance). Story D: Butch & the Gold Watch. Story B2: The Bonnie Situation (continuation of Vincent & Jules). Story A2: The Diner Part 2."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would Vince, a professional, leave a submachine gun on the counter at Butch's apartment for anyone to pick up while he uses the toilet?",
      "answer": "The MAC-10 isn't Vincent's, it belongs to Marsellus, who is staking out Butch's apartment with Vincent, but has gone for coffee and donuts, breakfast for himself and Vincent-Marsellus wouldn't have been able to conceal the MAC-10 on his person very easily if he'd taken it with him to get breakfast. Butch is extremely fortunate: his timing couldn't have been better when he entered his apartment while Marsellus was gone and Vincent was in the bathroom. Vincent probably hears Butch come in, but believing it is Marsellus, is not alarmed. As Butch is driving away after having retrieved his watch and killed Vincent, he encounters Marsellus on his way back to the apartment, carrying a box of donuts and two cups of coffee. The \"trivia track\" on the DVD confirms this interpretation to be correct. An added explanation that does not disagree with the above but adds a psychological dimension is that Vincent is demonstrably very careless with guns. In another scene, this carelessness costs someone else (Marvin) his life. Here, Vincent carelessly assumes that Butch would not be dumb enough to come back to his own apartment and, so, allows the gun to go unattended in the kitchen while he uses the facilities. Also, Marsellus and Vincent could have been waiting for anyone to come to Butch's apartment to interrogate them as to Butch's whereabouts: Butch could have sent Fabienne to get his watch thinking Marsellus and Vincent wouldn't know who she was. (Also, Vincent is seen to be using the facilities more often than any other character in the movie, at least three times, twice while reading the same book. The theme throughout the film is that whenever Vincent goes into the bathroom, something bad happens: Mia overdoses on his heroin, he's killed by Butch, and he finds himself in the middle of Pumpkin & Honeybunny's robbery of the restaurant.) It's also not out of the realm of possibility that Vincent didn't even know Marsellus had put the MAC-10 on the counter. If Vincent likes to read while using the restroom, it's entirely possible he was in there a while and may have been in there before Marsellus even left. Heroin addiction is known to cause constipation making that even more likely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Butch choose the samurai sword over all the other weapons?",
      "answer": "The overarching theme of the movie is retaining one's honor in the face of adversity. Butch was going to skip town and go on the run from Marsellus but he realizes that leaving Marsellus to be raped or worse by Maynard and Zed was dishonorable. When he selects a weapon (claw hammer, baseball bat, chain saw) they're all pretty messy things to use as weapons. The sword is associated with samurai, a position of honor in feudal Japan. Also, the sword is literally longer and more deadly than any of the other weapons he sifts through before he finds it. It's unlikely that Butch is an experienced user of the sword but he was also counting on surprise; Butch wouldn't have to get as close to Maynard or Zed to use it and risk them being able to counterattack very easily. The hammer isn't very practical because it doesn't have much striking distance. The chain saw has a very short blade and starting it would have quickly alerted Maynard and Zed giving them plenty of reaction time. And the bat has the length but Butch would risk a non-fatal injury that one of the guys could bounce back from. Look at the fear on Zed's face when Butch taunts him to pick up his pistol. Zed knows that Butch could easily cut his hand off in one stroke or injure him enough to land a second stroke and kill him then."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Butch save Marsellus?",
      "answer": "It's a question of honor, which is a major theme in all of Tarantino's films: Butch puts himself in Marsellus' position and decides that he would hate to be left to such a horrid fate; he cannot just leave somebody there, no matter who it is. Butch does the \"right thing\" to put it simply; he realises that Maynard and Zed cannot get away with what they are doing to anybody-who knows how many people they've raped, tortured or even killed in Maynard's basement prior to Marsellus and Butch stumbling into the shop?Butch may have also considered saving Marsellus an act of redemption. By saving his skin, he may have hoped that Marsellus would forgive him and let him go, if not, Butch may have killed Marsellus himself. Notice how Butch still stood ready to swing with the sword when he asked, \"What now?\" The former becomes the case, whether that was Butch's intention or not. Also, if Marsellus ever escaped and learned that Butch had left him there to his fate, Marsellus would sure unleash even more retaliation against Butch than he was subject to after double-crossing him at the fight.Consider the weapon Butch chooses: a samurai sword. The samurai are long-associated with honour towards their masters. If you want to simplify the overarching theme of the film, you could say it's about honor among thieves. There is also a clue to why Butch saves Marsellus; in the flashback scene with Christopher Walken's Captain Koons, and the young Butch. In the scene, Koons is relating his imprisonment with Butch's father, and tells Butch, \"Hopefully, you'll never have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were, for as long as we were, you take on certain responsibilities of the other.\" It's possible that these words came to Butch's mind as he was attempting to leave the pawn shop."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why not just let Jules and Vincent take showers in Jimmy's bathroom to get cleaned up?",
      "answer": "The entire reason Winston was sent to deal with \"The Bonnie Situation\" was because he's an incredibly efficient cleaner -- \"I think fast and I need you boys to act fast!\" Jimmy was already furious with Jules and Vincent for bringing a blood-soaked car with a dead body in the back seat to his house. Jules points out that Jimmy was incredibly close to kicking them out as it was, while Jules wouldn't allow that to happen before Marvin had been dealt with, he didn't want it to reach that point, as Jimmy was his friend. Winston was looking for the fastest way to get Vincent and Jules cleaned up, as well as get rid of any trace they were ever there before Jimmy's wife Bonnie arrived home from her night shift, while also trying to appease Jimmy's disapproval of the entire situation he had been put in. Had they taken turns in the shower, this would take up a significant amount of time. As the average male spends approximately 10 minutes in the shower, having to scrub the blood and brains off possibly extending this time to 15 to 20 minutes each. That's 30 to 40 minutes total, as well as making a bloody mess in the tub which would have to be cleaned, using up even more time, (keep in mind the car had to be cleaned as well). Also, it may have raised suspicion with Bonnie to arrive home to find the shower had been cleaned first thing in the morning, which could lead to her questioning Jimmy, which he risks being caught in a lie. The most efficient and safe method was to have them strip naked in the back yard and hose them both down at the same time. Any remaining blood and brain matter that was sprayed off of them could easily be washed away with the hose and Bonnie wouldn't be the wiser."
    },
    {
      "question": "How could Mia have OD'd?",
      "answer": "Mia is a cocaine user, and when she sees the heroin in Vincent's coat pocket, she just assumes that it is cocaine-it's a white powder in a plastic baggie, and it looks just like coke. The problem is that, when Vincent goes to Lance's house to score heroin, Lance informs him he is out of balloons and asks if a baggie would be all right. (Heroin is usually stashed by dealers in balloons, not baggies, most likely to avoid situations just like this! It is also put in balloons so if you are caught with it or need to safely transport it you can swallow it quickly then \"retrieve\" it later. Mia might have known the difference if Lance had been able to use a balloon.) The heroin he purchases is also described by Lance as being extremely potent (a \"mad man\"). Heroin is a depressant, whereas cocaine is a stimulant, the most likely reason for the overdose. Fortunately, Vincent gets her to Lance's house in time to save her with the adrenaline shot. (The whole heroin/cocaine mix-up is foreshadowed in Lance's comments to Vince, \"Coke is dead as... dead. Heroin is coming back in a big way.\")"
    },
    {
      "question": "What was Vincent's problem with Butch at the bar?",
      "answer": "Vince was having a very bad morning! He was almost killed by a man who was shooting at him, then he accidentally shot Marvin in the face while they were driving, which made a mess of the car, himself and Jules. Jules gives Vincent a hard time over it despite it being an accident, had to \"take shit\" from the Wolf, Jules and Jimmy; he had to help Jules clean up all the brains, blood and skull that used to be Marvin's head and Jules forces him to take the messier part of cleaning up the car; he had to strip down naked and get hosed down with freezing cold water in order to clean the blood off himself; he had to wear dorky clothes given to him by Jimmy, and finally he was caught in the middle of a Mexican stand-off at the diner when he and Jules went to breakfast. To top it all off, his best friend and partner (Jules) had just decided to quit the business they were in, right after Vincent had come back from several years living in Amsterdam -- he was probably looking forward to reconnecting with his old friend and getting back into the business and enjoying life in the USA again.This was all in the span of about 3 or 4 hours, a LOT of bad luck in a short time. So Vince finally shows up at his destination, then gets teased by Paul the bartender about his taking Mia out to dinner, when Butch came up to the bar. Vince probably knew or assumed why Butch was at the bar -- Marsellus was paying him to take a dive. Vincent may not respect people who are willing to betray their principles for money. So when Butch asked if he was looking at something, Vince took the opportunity to insult him."
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Vince call Butch when they were at the bar?",
      "answer": "Vincent called Butch \"Palooka,\" a reference to a cartoon character named Joe Palooka, who was portrayed in a long-running comic series as a heavyweight boxing champion. In Vincent's eyes, \"Palooka\" would be a derogatory term for boxers in general, implying he looked down on Butch for his profession. It's also a fairly popular euphemism from the 1950s to refer to anyone who appears oafish or dumb. Butch is obviously not either but it was a convenient insult for Vincent to use. After Butch asks, \"What's that?\" Vincent says, \"I think you heard me just fine, Punchy,\" obviously another crack at Butch's profession, because the term \"punchy\" when referring to boxers is a word used to describe a boxer who has been in the game too long and has been punched too much and it shows -- they may look battered physically or may be slow-witted because of brain damage. In Butch's case, neither was the case but Vincent, already in a bad mood, decided to chide him about it anyway."
