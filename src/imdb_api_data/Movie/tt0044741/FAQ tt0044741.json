Fall in love, maidens, Before his hands take up his boat, Before the flush of his cheeks fades, For those of you who will never return here.Life is brief. Fall in love, maidens, Before the boat drifts away on the waves, Before the hand resting on your shoulder becomes frail, For those who will never be seen here again.Life is brief.
