      "question": "How does \"Network\" end?",
      "answer": "After Howard Beale was read the \"You Have Meddled with the Primal Forces of Nature, and You Will Atone\" riot act by Mr. Arthur Jensen (the president of the network's parent company), the tenor of Beale's monologues softened and his ratings started to fall. The network execs, including Frank Hackett and Diana Christensen, wanted to dump Beale because they feared his sagging numbers would take the entire network down with him. However, they could not fire him because Mr. Jensen had taken a liking to the \"new\" Beale and would not allow Beale's show to be canceled. Unable to fire Beale, the network execs decide the only way to get rid of him is to have him killed: and so they enlist two audience members, including the Great Ahmed Kahn, to assassinate Beale during a live broadcast of his show."

      "question": "Any recommendations for a female character as annoying as Diana Christensen?",
      "answer": "The money-grubbing Veda Forrester () in Mildred Pierce (1945) should be enough to raise your hankles. Many find Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) in Gone with the Wind (1939) to be infuriating, although some viewers say that they feel sorry for her at the end. Eve (Anne Baxter) in All About Eve (1950) is also high on a lot of people's detestation-meter as is Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) in Any Given Sunday (1999). Edit"
