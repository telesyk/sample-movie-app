      "question": "What happened to Tanner's folder?",
      "answer": "More than likely Fletcher took it because he had said he did not want to see another folder left laying around. Another possibility is that Andrew either hid the folder or lost it on purpose to sabotage Tanner and take his place as the core drummer.Edit: In the screenplay, it's revealed that a janitor threw out the folder on accident. It's likely in post-production this bit was cut to make it seem more malicious."
