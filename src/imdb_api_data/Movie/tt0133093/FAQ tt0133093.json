      "question": "How did Morpheus realize that Neo is the \"One\"?",

      "question": "Why does the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar have to answer payphones to get back from the Matrix? Why can't they use their cell phones?",
      "answer": "It was stated in the movie that you'd have to jack in and out of The Matrix through a \"Hard Line\". The reason for this was never stated in the movie, however it could be related to the fact that back in 1999 when \"The Matrix\" movie came out, internet access via cell phones wasn't very widespread, and largely unknown to a lot of people. Additionally, it was hinted in the movie that you can't just use any telephone... there seemed to be specific \"access points/back doors\" through which hackers could hack in and out of The Matrix. These access points seemed to include specific old payphones or old regular telephones."

    {
      "question": "What is \"The Matrix\" about?",
      "answer": "The story is set at an indeterminate point in the future, estimated by one character to be the 22nd century, in which human bodies are used for heat and electrical energy while their minds are held in a computer-generated, virtual reality simulation called the Matrix. Humans are essentially slaves in this world. People in the Matrix are subject to the lifelong, full-sensory illusion that they inhabit modern times at the turn of the century. Computer programmer/hacker Thomas \"Neo\" Anderson (), who may be \"the One\", joins a Resistance led by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and several other freed humans, including Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Apoc (Julian Arahanga), Tank (Marcus Chong) and his brother Dozer (Anthony Ray Parker), Switch (Belinda McClory), Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), and Mouse (Matt Doran). They endeavor to expose the truth, overthrow the Matrix, and defeat the vengeful and warlike Machines behind it. Edit"

    {
      "question": "Is \"The Matrix\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "The Matrix is based on a screenplay by Lilly and Lana Wachowski, who also directed the movie. The Matrix has led to three sequels, ,The Matrix Revolutions (2003) and The Matrix Resurrections (2021), the animated anthology feature The Animatrix (2003), comprised of 9 shorts, and a number of video games. So far, there have been no official novelizations, but a number of comics have been published, featuring the work of comic book luminaries like including Neil Gaiman and Dave Gibbons. Edit"

    {
      "question": "What is \"the One\"?",
      "answer": "The One is the man prophesied to release the humans from their bondage to the Matrix through his unique ability to manipulate the Matrix. The One is supposedly the only individual in all of humanity capable of doing such a thing. It was prophesied by the Oracle that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix and bring freedom to the human race. Morpheus is convinced that Neo is that man, although others, Neo included, are not so sure. As explained by the Architect (of the Matrix) in the second movie, the One is a program anomaly that the Matrix could not account for; an anomaly that occurs because humans have to be given a choice (if the only an illusion of such) in order to accept the virtual world the machines have created for them. No matter what, the anomaly that is the One occurs, so a way for the Matrix to control the situation (i.e. to control choice) was devised. According to the Architect, the current One had five predecessors who served the function of the One. Once Neo encounters the Architect, he is told of the choice of the One: to choose a certain number of humans to repopulate a destroyed Zion and start all over again, or to choose to go leave the Architect's lair permanently, thereby letting Zion fall and causing the mutual destruction of both the machines and the humans. The One is basically a real world reset switch. There are those in the Matrix that will never fully accept the machines' reality, and they will find ways to leave the Matrix for the human city of Zion. Once the free human population of Zion grows too large, it poses a threat to the machines; therefore the One is reintroduced to the Matrix to restart the cycle. The first of the two options presented to the One, should he choose to accept it, satisfies this plan: saving humanity and bringing balance as prophesied. Each of the five predecessors to Neo chose to save humanity."

    {
      "question": "How does Morpheus know everything about Neo's office during the phone call?",
      "answer": "Morpheus is watching the green raining code screens on the Nebuchadnezzar. The code is the visual representation of the Matrix. He's able to decode what he sees on the screen, giving him a full view of Neo's office building, locations of Agents, the existence of the window washer platform, etc. Think of it like unlimited security camera footage."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can the Agents seal up Neo's mouth?",
      "answer": "At this point in the film, Neo is still connected to the Matrix, so the Agents still have control over his body and can make modifications. Agents are computer programs and Neo is still linked into the program. It's possible that some other program which is confederate with the Agents is what seals Neo's mouth. The next thing that happens is that Neo wakes up in his own bed, making it all seem like a dream, so the Agents also have the ability to temporarily shut down his program and reactivate it at will."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is that road that Neo has been down before?",
      "answer": "A metaphor. This was not referring to any specific physical place, but rather to the act of Neo getting out of the car and not getting the answers he sought. In the past, he probably used to run away from the truth; this is the \"road\" that he has been down before, and Morpheus' team knows that he does not want to go that way again."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's the deal with the red pill and blue pill?",
      "answer": "Morpheus offers Neo the choice of either a blue pill, which will render him unconscious and give him the impression that all of the recent events were simply a dream, or a red pill. The red pill, as Morpheus states, is a gesture in the real world of Neo's mind's desire to be freed and is part of a tracing program that will help Morpheus and his crew locate Neo quickly after he awakes in the world beyond the Matrix."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does Switch mean when she refers to Neo as \"copper-top\"?",
      "answer": "\"Copper-top\" is the nickname used in US commercials for Duracell Batteries. In the film, it's a slur to describe people who unconsciously inhabit the Matrix, since (according to the freed humans' beliefs) the Machines use them like batteries-sources of power. This can confuse some viewers, because copper-top can also be used as a nickname for redheads. Thanks to those duracell commercials."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where exactly does the Nebuchadnezzar operate?",
      "answer": "The Nebuchadnezzar is a hovercraft flying through the abandoned subway and sewer lines beneath the destroyed surface of the Earth. Somewhere in the sewers are tunnels leading to Zion, very far below the surface."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does \"There is no spoon\" mean?",
      "answer": "The spoon exists only in the Matrix, which really means it doesn't exist. It's a lesson for Neo, to help him realize that manipulating the Matrix isn't about focusing on an object and trying to change it. The object doesn't exist, so he can't change it, he has to change himself. Metaphorically, it's all in his head."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does \"bake your noodle\" mean?",
      "answer": "\"Noodle\", in this context, is a slang term for brain, so named because of the one's loose resemblance to the other. So, \"bake your noodle\" means \"make your brain work hard\". It can also mean to confuse someone."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is Zion?",
      "answer": "Zion is where free humans live. Far below the destroyed surface of the earth, the citizens of Zion are both former inhabitants of the Matrix who've been freed, and also 100% home-grown humans that have never been slaves to the Matrix."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the wall of TV screens seen when Neo gets arrested?",
      "answer": "At first it looks just like a screen wall that you would expect in a police station's guard room, to monitor several areas at the same time, but that does not explain why Neo is displayed on every screen. The sequel The Matrix Reloaded later revealed this wall to be located in the Source, which is actually the origin of the signal that constitutes the entire Matrix. In the Source, the Architect (of the Matrix) resides. The Architect is the Machine program that created the Matrix. The Architect apparently keeps a close watch on Neo, and the reason for this is that Neo is a complex and intricate part in the Machines' ploy to keep the humans subdued."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do people have babies in the Matrix?",
      "answer": "Morpheus explains to Neo that babies are not born—they are grown. This suggests that the usual human birth cycle (in utero fertilization and growth followed by birth at term) is not being followed. What is shown is that human fetuses form/grow in artificial wombs located away from the \"power plant\" (where Matrix inhabitants' out-simulation bodies are connected to the Matrix's hardware) until they reach their would-be birthing ages; after which time, if they are viable, they are relocated to the \"power plant\", inserted into adult pods and hardwired to the system. It can be inferred from this that new humans are conceived altogether outside of the Matrix. The most likely method is by cloning or by harvesting oocytes (unfertilized egg cells) and fertilizing them with harvested sperm, then placing the zygotes (fertilized egg cells) in artificial gestation as embryos, some of which may be allowed to develop and others of which (as Morpheus also explains) are liquefied as food. As for how do people procreate while connected to the Matrix, it's possible they don't, since we never see any pregnant women inside the Matrix; meaning that upon joining the virtual reality, babies in the Matrix possibly materialize out of thin air (or are assigned to baby avatars that were grown from zygote avatars therein) and are delivered by stork or (more likely) postmen. Yet all sorts of tubes are attached the out-simulation bodies of Matrix inhabitants. So it's impossible to say for sure. Just as there are tubes for feeding the bodies intravenously, there may be tubes for extracting reproductive fluids (containing gametes) for, as aforementioned, harvesting the gametes (oocytes and sperms). Along the latter lines or alternately, there is the possibility is that when the Machines grow a new human infant, they pre-program a couple inside the Matrix to conceive a child. Overall, although never born in reality, presumably Matrix inhabitants are born in the virtual reality after having been conceived outside of it, grown for nine months and then connected to its hardware."

      "question": "Were the actors martial artists?",
      "answer": "The actors that were hired had some kind of physical background: Carrie Anne-Moss was a dancer and Keanu Reeves used to play ice hockey. The actors underwent a hard training regimen for several months prior to filming."
    },
    {
      "question": "If the Agents still had control over Neo in the beginning, why didn't one of the Agents just take over Neo's body and effectively kill him?",
      "answer": "It isn't made clear what the rules are for the Agents to take over a person's body, but as shown in the movie, they wanted to use Neo in order to locate Morpheus and kill him and the rest of his group. Originally the agents tried to get Neo to simply agree to help them in order to have his criminal record expunged. When this fails they grab hold of Neo and put a tracking device into his stomach (also possible, given that it had some sort of bio-mechanical function that it could have taken over Neo's body causing him to fall under the control of the Agents). To explain why the agents wouldn't take over Neo while Neo was with Morpheus is likely because they likely need to be within a certain radius from Neo. As the tracking device was removed from Neo, the agents didn't know where Neo was and could not take over his body. Also, after the Agents release Neo, Morpheus calls him and says, \"They have seriously underestimated how important you are. If they knew what I know; you'd probably be dead.\" So simple naivety or arrogance on part of the Agents is likely why they didn't kill him."

      "question": "Why didn't \"The Matrix\" win any major Oscars?",
      "answer": "Usually, science fiction films rarely even get nominated for the \"majors\" (Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Picture), and none have ever won. However, The Matrix did win four Academy Awards in the \"technical categories\" - Sound Effects, Visual Effects, Sound and Editing. Keep in mind as well that 1999 was an unusually strong year for film. Those twelve months saw the release of , Payback (1999), Todo sobre mi madre (1999), Bringing Out the Dead (1999), The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), American Beauty (1999) (the Best Picture winner that year), Man on the Moon (1999), Being John Malkovich (1999), Topsy-Turvy (1999), Boys Don't Cry (1999), Magnolia (1999), The Straight Story (1999), Election (1999), Toy Story 2 (1999), The Insider (1999), Lola rennt (1998), Three Kings (1999), The Sixth Sense (1999), and Fight Club (1999). All of those titles either upon release or over the years were celebrated as outstanding films by audiences and critics alike. An argument could be made for any of them to have deserved \"major\" Academy Awards. In addition, This film beat out Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) for the Visual Effects Academy Award, the first time a film of the Star Wars to be beaten in such a category. Edit"

      "question": "Why did humans scorch the sky while it hurt them more than machines themselves? (as we know machines, due to more advanced intelligence, can quickly adapt to life with other forms of energy, such as fossil fuels)",
      "answer": "Morpheus explains that while little detail is known about the apocalyptic end of the surface world, it is known that humans are the ones who blocked out the sun. Morpheus says that the machines were reliant on solar power and humans decided that the machines could be stopped by darkening the sky. When that happened, humans found themselves unable to grow food and live without the sun, which is our world's greatest source of energy, and so the Machines enslaved humans, using their body heat as a new energy source.The apocalyptic events that led to the destruction of Earth's habitable surface are documented in the Animatrix prequel short films. In one of them, Operation Dark Storm, the official name given to the plan, is explained."

    {
      "question": "In Part 2, it is said by the architect that 99% of the people accept the simulated reality, and only 1% of them leave the virtual world. Why didn't the machines create a solution to get rid of the 1% at the very beginning of work?",
      "answer": "Agent Smith explains in the first film that the Machines' first attempts to control the human mind ended in failure. The first versions of the Matrix looked like a paradise, but the majority of people hooked to the Matrix rejected this reality as fake. The Machines 'lost entire crops', which probably meant that either those humans' minds and bodies perished (the body cannot exist without the mind is another Morpheus quote), or they started to revolt and died during altercations with Agents who tried to end the uprisings.Smith alleges that the first version of the Matrix may have failed because the Machines lacked the understanding of the human mind to create their idea of a perfect world, i.e. their version of paradise was not accurate enough for humans to accept. However, he dismisses this notion, suggesting instead that adversity and suffering are part of human life, so their world needed to reflect that. Hence the simulation of the world as it was in 1999.In part 2, the Architect adds that it was the Oracle who 'stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 99% of the test subjects accepted the program provided they were given a choice'. This 'choice' means that they must be allowed to be freed from the Matrix if they choose to. 99% of the humans is perfectly happy inside the Matrix; 1% rejects the fake reality, seeks out like-minded people, and will eventually be disconnected from the Matrix to live in Zion.Apparently, the Machines have no way to predict who will reject the Matrix, otherwise they might consider eliminating those before they become rebellious. However, killing anyone as soon as they want to leave the Matrix may be impossible (the Agents apparently cannot keep total surveillance on everyone). It may be undesired as well: news of frequent killings will spread quickly throughout the Matrix, and only contribute to more unrest. Their solution is thus to allow those people to escape; as long as the freed humans are in Zion in limited numbers, they do not pose too much of a threat.So the Machines/Agents try to intimidate or eliminate the 1% who are wise to the Matrix (as shown by the Agents interrogating Neo with threats early in the first film), but as you can see, they are not always successful. Ironically, this treatment may also be part of the Matrix' design, to help the 1% make the choice to reject their reality, and try to escape."

      "question": "Neo would become \"The One\" through learning martial skills from Morpheus' team, as well as mental strength training, and ultimately falling in love, but in Part 2, we find that he is also part of a matrix and some kind of computer program! How is it possible?",
      "answer": "The idea being that the One is both organic and code at the same time, and the One is an inherited position and a necessarily reoccurring part of the Matrix."
    },
    {
      "question": "Would machines not be able to find a faster, smarter, and lower-risk solution to neutralize the threat of a 1% population that does not accept their virtual reality?",
      "answer": "The second and third films show that the machines are actively hunting the humans that have escaped the Matrix and/or live in Zion. They also try to stop those who become aware of the Matrix before they escape, but aren't always successful."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are \"Agents\"?",
      "answer": "Agents, such as Agent Smith (), are intelligent security programs, which over-write the digital 'bodies' of humans connected bodily to the Matrix, but cannot do the same to the heroes of the story, who connect to the Matrix through radio signals. Agents are the gatekeepers of the Matrix, while Sentinels (search and destroy vessels) are the gatekeepers of the machine-occupied regions of the world outside of the Matrix. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "How did Cypher get into the Matrix to meet with Agent Smith?",
      "answer": "The Art of the Matrix's script notes on an extended version of this scene confirm the fan theory that Cypher rigged the system to connect him to the Matrix automatically while the others were busy elsewhere. This is why he jumps so much when Neo surprises him. Cypher casually but quickly turns off several screens, including three that have real time imagery instead of the Matrix code. This would likely be so that the inquisitive Neo wouldn't ask him about it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did the Oracle tell Neo that he wasn't the One?",
      "answer": "The Oracle () never explicitly tells Neo that he is not the One, in fact, Neo says it. She expresses sorrow that he seems to be \"waiting for something.\" He can't be told he is \"the One\", he has to believe it; much like what Morpheus had been alluding to during the training sequence.The Oracle was a program used to investigate the human psyche. she discovered that humans could be kept alive and asleep as long as they at least subconsciously believed they had a choice. Everything she did was manipulation to achieve the grand scheme of steering Neo toward the architect while letting them think they were actually controlling their own destiny. The Matrix (and life) is all about control vs choice. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "How come Apoc and Switch died when Cypher unplugged them?",
      "answer": "Morpheus says, \"The body cannot live without the mind\"; but they appear to die of the shock of a sudden disconnection. It's likely that the disconnect forms some sort of data corruption between the user's mind and the Matrix, and as a result the user's central nervous system suffers irreparable damage. Even in real life, when users transfer a file from a computer to a portable hard drive, and sever the connection before the transfer is complete, the file will be damaged and useless. Something similar is implied here."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Agent Smith remove his earphone when talking to Morpheus?",
      "answer": "He doesn't want the other Agents to know what he's saying to Morpheus. The Agents seem to operate collectively, finishing each others' sentences at times and certainly knowing what each is thinking. Smith's actions may largely be symbolic to show that he's able to turn this collective consciousness off and, in this case, has a reason to. His discussion with Morpheus implies that he is much more \"human\" than his colleagues: he shows frustration, exhaustion, impatience, and hatred for the Matrix itself and his place in it."

    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "Pursued in the Matrix by the three Agents, Neo races for the exit at the Heart O' the City Hotel, room 303. The moment he gets inside, however, Agent Smith empties his gun into his chest. Neo slumps to the floor as, back in the Nebuchadnezzar, Trinity, Tank, and Morpheus watch incredulously as Neo's body flatlines. As the Sentinels continue to break through the hull of the ship, Trinity whispers into Neo's ear that the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One, so Neo must be the One because \"I love you,\" she says and kisses him. Neo suddenly begins to breathe. At the same time, he awakens in the Matrix now knowing that he is, indeed, the One. When the Agents empty their guns at him, he stops the bullets in mid-air. When Agent Smith tries to attack him, Neo easily bests him and takes over his body, destroying him. The other two agents run away, and Neo transports back to the ship just as Morpheus orders the electromagnetic pulser (EMP) to be engaged, destroying the attacking Sentinels. In the final scene, as the blank screen fills with system prompts and a grid of numbers, a voiceover by Neo says, I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid... you're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone, and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you. In the Matrix world, Neo hangs up the phone. He looks at the masses around him, puts on his glasses, looks up, and takes flight."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does Trinity's kiss revive Neo?",
      "answer": "The brain does not die immediately when heart and respiration stops. Neo was almost the One, he'd not been affected by the first bullet, until he saw his blood. So, his mind was almost to the point of disbelieving the illusion of the Matrix-that he should be injured by bullets. He could feel Trinity's kiss or hear her words, somehow, which reminds him that the Matrix is not real-that his injury is not real."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Neo see the 3 agents as green code after he comes back to life?",
      "answer": "Now that he truly believes he is the One, Neo is beginning to use his consciousness over the Matrix. He can now see the Matrix for what it is, and this will lead to additional abilities to manipulate it as he sees it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who is Neo talking to on the phone at the end of the movie?",
      "answer": "Neo is talking (possibly metaphorically) to the Machine mainframe. He's talking to the Source, to the power behind the Machines, to whatever sends the Agents after him. And he's telling it/them that he's done running, that he can defeat them and because of that the best for both sides is that the Machines simply stop attacking humanity."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why don't the Machines use animals besides humans for energy?",
      "answer": "They need the access to the human mind: it fuels the story line. If this was an animal-induced world, it would be pretty far behind technologically. Based on all available information about the setting of the Matrix movies, the easiest explanation to accept would be that too few animals are left alive after the war between humans and the Machines. However, in \"Matriculated\", an segment of , a monkey named Baby is depicted with functional implants for jacking into simulations, evidence that the Machines could indeed insert some animals into the Matrix. Scientifically, the whole premise that Machines need to harvest human body heat to survive is dubious at best. For one thing, there's no adequate explanation of how the humans are kept alive. (Feeding them the liquid corpses wouldn't be enough.) Furthermore, other forms of fusion would probably prove more efficient. At the Machines' level of technology, solar power could still be an option, despite the sun being blocked off. Fans have proposed some alternate explanations for why people are kept alive in the Matrix. One intriguing idea is that the Machines cannot artificially replicate certain qualities of biological sentience/sapience and are secretly using human brains as CPUs; or, actually lack sufficient numbers of their own kind for adequate processing power, until the end of the trilogy. Otherwise, it is conceivable that the human race is being preserved for conservationist, ethical, sadistic or sentimental reasons. Edit"
