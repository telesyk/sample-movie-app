      "answer": "Mike tracks down Nick, finding him in a seedy, Russian roulette club in Saigon, but Nick doesn't recognize him. Mike buys his way into a game with Nick so that he can continue to try and jog Nick's memory but to no avail. After playing the first round successfully, Mike grabs Nick's arms and notices the tracks along the veins. He tries to remind Nick of the forests and their hunting trips together. \"One shot,\" Nick replies, seeming to remember their hunting motto. Suddenly, he raises the gun to his temple, takes his \"one shot,\" and the shot is fatal. The final scene takes place in a bar back in Clairton, following Nick's funeral. Mike, Steve, Linda (), et al, sit down to a very somber breakfast while singing \"God Bless America\", following which they raise their glasses of beer in a toast to Nick. Edit"
