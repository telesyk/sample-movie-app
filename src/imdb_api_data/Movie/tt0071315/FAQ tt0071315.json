      "question": "Evelyn Mulray's middle initial was C, which she said stands for Cross since she Noah Cross's daughter. Am I to understand then that her full maiden name was Evelyn Cross Cross?",
      "answer": "Evelyn's maiden name was \"Evelyn Cross.\" Her middle name--if she has one--is not stated. When she marries, she takes her maiden name as the middle 'C' in her initials, thus the new initials of \"E C M.\""

      "question": "Is \"Chinatown\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "Chinatown is based on an original screenplay written by Robert Towne. A sequel called The Two Jakes (1990) was also based on a screenplay by Robert Towne and stars Jack Nicholson (who also directed it)."

      "question": "What is the meaning of \"Chinatown\" and the last lines of the movie?",
      "answer": "As a young man, Jake was a police officer in Chinatown. He once tried to protect a woman, but as a direct result of his intervention, she was \"hurt\" (an implication that the woman died). As a result, Jake became cynical and apathetic. So Chinatown is actually a metaphor for failure and inability to do one's job. Over the course of his investigation in the film, Jake again tries to protect a woman, and once again, she is killed as a direct result of his intervention. Jake's last line, \"As little as possible\" refers to his earlier conversation with Evelyn, where she asked him what he did as assistant to the District Attorney in Chinatown. His reply was \"as little as possible\", probably referring to the fact that corruption and crime ran so rampant that Jake got the feeling that he did not amount to anything, and may even have inadvertantly helped injustice take place. His repeating of the line after Evelyn's death is his way of reconfirming his failure to dispense any justice in Chinatown; all the actions he took to protect Evelyn have even helped to cause her demise. \"Forget it, Jake; it's Chinatown\" is an encouragement to Jake to forget this set of circumstances, just as he \"forgot\" the circumstances surrounding his time in Chinatown. The dramatic irony of this is that the viewer knows that Jake has never forgotten what happened in Chinatown, and that he will probably never forget the events depicted in the movie, inevitably leading to him becoming even more cynical and apathetic than he was already."

      "question": "Is there a sequel to this movie?",
      "answer": "Yes, it's called , the title referring to Jake Gittes himself and another character named Julius \"Jake\" Berman, played by Harvey Keitel. It was released in 1990 after many years of legal hangups and failed attempts at production. It was originally to have been directed by Robert Towne, who wrote the screenplay for Chinatown. Eventually the film was directed by Jack Nicholson. It was generally panned by critics when it was released. Edit"

      "question": "Please explain the plotline about the drunk who drowned?",
      "answer": "The man was homeless and had been living under one of the bridges that Hollis was investigating for freshwater runoff. There's a short scene, right before Jake talks to the Mexican boy on the horse, where Jake takes a long hard look at one of the columns under the bridge and sees the bureau dresser the coroner was talking about. Jake talks to the boy, whom Jake had seen talking to Hollis, and finds out that there had been water running through the seemingly dry riverbed. When Cross' plans called for some of the freshwater to be run off, it passed through this riverbed at night, probably at high speed and volume, and flowed over the homeless man while he was asleep or passed out, drowning him."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the reason that water is occassionally dumped through the channels and ducts?",
      "answer": "Hollis Mulwray learned about the illegal dumpings and was investigating them himself. Jake witnessed water being dumped for the first time when he was following Hollis; the duct behind him starts to spill water into the ocean. When Jake later goes to investigate the deaths of Mulwray and the allegedly drunk homeless man, he gets confirmation from a young local boy that the LA river has recently been used to divert water, as well as some other places. When he investigates Oak Pass Reservoir, where Hollis' body was found, he nearly drowns when a large amount of water is drained through the spillway he was hiding in. He confronts Mulwray's successor, Mr Yelburton, with this information, but Yelburton replies that they are courteously diverting some water in order to help orange farmers in the San Fernando Valley, and that some of the water is spilled in the process. However, when Jake goes to the farmers to confirm this story, they tell him that not only is LA's Water & Power Company cutting them off from natural water, they are even sabotaging their few remaining water storage tanks and wells in order to drive them away from the land.Jake later finds out that all the farming land in the Valley that has become worthless due to the drought is bought up cheaply by the people around Noah Cross. Their intention is to re-irrigate the area as soon as they own it all, making the land fertile and valuable again. However, for that, they need the new dam and water reservoir to be built, which requires the approval of the city and a positive vote from the Citizens' Committee. That would only work if there was a genuine water shortage in LA. Apparently, the water company is doing too good a job in stealing water away from the surrounding valleys; so much that they have to illegally dump some of it from time to time to maintain their claim that there is indeed a water shortage. Mulwray was opposed to the new dam and reservoir because he knew that due to the widespread corruption, the new dam would be unsafe and another accident waiting to happen; but another reason for him was that he suspected that the water company was artificially creating a demand for it, and only Noah and his people would profit highly from it. And that's why he was killed for it."

      "question": "What is the significance of the word \"apple core\", that was overheard by one of Jake Gittes' associates during the argument between Hollis Mulwray and Noah Cross?",
      "answer": "Jake's associate, Walsh, simply misheard. He was watching the two from a parked car some distance away and there was noise coming from the street he was parked on. The word the two men were using was \"Albacore\". We later learn that the Albacore Club is the exclusive fishing club owned by Noah Cross. Cross and Mulwray were probably arguing about it because Mulwray was finding out how Cross uses his club as a front to cheaply buy pieces of drought-stricken land in the name of unknowing senior citizens from the Mar Vista Rest Home (of which he is a patron). Cross and Mulwray were already on bad terms: Cross did not like that Mulwray had de-privatized the water company, whereas Mulwray never forgave Cross for forcing him to approve the building of the first dam that had ruptured and killed hundreds of people. Plus, Mulwray knew about Cross' sordid history with his daughter and granddaughter."

      "question": "Why are there so many references to eyes and vision?",
      "answer": "Roman Polanski included so many references to eyes and vision to highlight the fact that the truth isn't always what we see-a main theme of the film."

      "question": "Why did a woman pretend to be Mulwray's wife and why did she want the detective to follow Mulwray?",
      "answer": "She was hired by Noah Cross or some of Cross' people to expose Hollis Mulwray's affair with Katherine. The woman who impersonated Evelyn was named Ida Sessions. She meets with Jake, tells him that her husband is having an affair and wants Jake to get proof. Cross' plan was to scandalize his business partner in the news perhaps to force his hand in allowing the dam that Hollis refuses to build. (A previous damming project Hollis had overseen had failed and caused a number of deaths.) Cross wanted the dam built so he could open up a large swath of land for a lucrative housing deal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why didn't Hollis want to build the dam everyone seems to desperate to have done?",
      "answer": "Hollis had previously overseen the building of another dam that had failed, causing the deaths of a number of people downstream. Hollis says very specifically at the public forum that the rock at the proposed site of the new dam is the same kind of rock from the previous damming project. That rock is too weak to handle the pressure that would be created by the proposed dam. He simply refuses to make the same mistake again.What makes his refusal complicated is that the farmers in the area where the newer damn would be built are losing crops and livestock because of the drought LA is experiencing and because of Noah Cross' efforts to choke off the water supply. Cross wants to force the farmers in the area to sell their land to him cheaply so he can re-irrigate the land and turn it into prime real estate. Such a project would make hundreds of millions of dollars for Cross, perhaps even more in the future.The politics of the situation also come into play: Hollis is arguing his refusal at a public forum with city councilmen and perhaps other politicians involved, all of whom want the project to go forward. They probably stand to make millions from it, make millions for the city of Los Angeles and can ensure their re-elections in the future."

      "question": "How historically accurate is the final scene? Despite this movie's depiction of a seamy 1938 Los Angeles, would standard police procedure of that era really have allowed an officer to fire a revolver at a moving car more than 25 yards away with two civilians aboard? Would he really have continued firing despite having full knowledge that he is endangering the life of an innocent child inside that car? I must add that Polanski's passion for film noir results in him spoiling otherwise good movies with silly endings; \"The Ghostwriter\" is the most egregious example.",

      "question": "Was Mulray actually having an affair with Katherine? That would be his step-daughter, if so. Their brief on-screen time showed the boat ride and their embrace in the courtyard of the apartments. It's unclear whether this was evidence of an affair. Was this just another way Gittes was set up? Purposely ambiguous?",
      "answer": "I dont think so. Not sure. I think that Mulray was just seeing his wife's daughter, making sure she was ok, and kept away from the father Noah Cross. I may be wrong, but I dont see an affair here. just visiting a vulnerable young woman."

    {
      "question": "What is Noah Cross' ultimate plan?",
      "answer": "Noah's scheme really breaks down into two different schemes:1. He was surreptitiously buying up desert land in the San Fernando Valley, which was at the time farmland. It is now suburbs, and home to nearly 2 million people. Noah was denying water to the farmers (and sending out thugs that worked for him to terrorize them: poisoning their wells, blowing up their water tanks, like the old farmer claims) to encourage or coerce them to sell their land, then using the identities of the residents of the retirement home to purchase land at a discount. He would then use his influence and knowledge of the water system to ensure the land would be provided with a supply of fresh water for future residents. Noah and his descendants would be rich. Hollis Mulwray, Cross' old business partner, did a lot of investigation on his own and was close to discovering the full extent of Noah's scheme. Noah knew about it and had him murdered.2. Cross was also trying to find his granddaughter, Katherine Mulwray, who was the progeny of an incestuous affair Noah had with his daughter, Evelyn. While the real reason for Cross' plans for his granddaughter is not state specifically, he does say at one point that he's \"only got one daughter left\" and \"she's mine too\" in his last scene with Evelyn. It's left up to the viewer to decide what Cross actually has in mind when he takes Katherine for himself in the last scene."
