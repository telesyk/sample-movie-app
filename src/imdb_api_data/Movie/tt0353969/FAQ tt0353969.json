      "question": "Is this based on a real story?",
      "answer": "Yes, the movie is loosely based on a series of real murders committed in South Korea. The case is known as the Hwaesong Serial Murders. However, not all the crimes are shown in this film. The film only shows up to the 8th victim out of 10 victims total. The film ranges from 1986-1989 while the actual crimes range from 1986-1991 so the expiration date for the statue of limitations expired on April 2, 2006. (Statute of Limitations shows that first-degree murder can last up to 15 years from the latest crime before expiration.) There are also a few moments of dark comedy that is of course used to lighten the overall atmosphere of the film and is mostly fiction to ease the audience from the suspense."

      "question": "Who is the serial killer?",
      "answer": "The movie provides no definite answer. The first two main suspects (the mentally challenged young man and the pervert caught next to the crime scene) are exonerated. The detectives confront the last suspect, Hyun-gyu, but there is no direct evidence against him and the DNA test results are inconclusive.In the epilogue, an older detective Park revisits a murder scene and a young girl tells him another man recently stopped by the same place to remember \"something\" he did there time ago, strongly implying the unknown man was the murderer. The girl however can provide no description, simply stating the man looked \"ordinary\".The story is based on the real murders committed by a serial killer in South Korea during the Eighties. When the movie was filmed the culprit was still unknown. In 2019, however, the murderer has finally been identified and the police has obtained confessions for all the unsolved cases plus others which had been previously considered unrelated. The culprit was already serving a life sentence for another murder."

      "question": "Why did Bong show the killer charging at the 4th victim if he wanted to keep ambiguity as to who the killer is?",
      "answer": "If you were mentioning the scene where the lady started running in the rain and the guy popping out of the field at night, then I can answer that the scene was shot so quick and it's difficult to get a clear picture of who the killer is despite his face popping up briefly. You weren't really supposed to progress what the guy's face looked like and of course it may have been some random actor or crew member that did this scene. But it doesn't reveal what character it was or even if it was a character that many people suspected, the answer wouldn't be true anyways. This was just played for dramatic effects to get the audience on the edge of their seats. Plus, movies are always shown in theaters so they never pause just to look at a guy. So in the end, it was used for cinematic effects but isn't the actual killer but perhaps some crew member or actor that jumped out of nowhere just to scare the audience."
