      "question": "Why would they take all that time looking for bonds and not take any cash from the armored truck?",
      "answer": "They are professionals. The job was specifically targeting the bonds. They know the response time of police, and need to be in and out as fast as possible. This greatly minimises the risk of getting caught and also the loose cash could be marked or have tracers or dye packs if any of it was decoy money. The bonds are worth more than the loose cash in the van. As for selling the bonds back to the original owner, the rationale for that was also explained.This exchange between Bosko and Hanna explains it well:Bosko: According to TV man this guy started mouthing off some body called the guard \"slick\", this guy here has got what it appears to be a double tapped entry wound to the sternum entry wounds to the head means close range probably executed and it was a million six in bearer bonds ignored the loose cash.Vincent Hanna: Because they had no time because they were on the clock which means they knew our response time to a two eleven had our air mobilized it enter escape in under three minutes. It's a good spot here... they got good escape routes two freeways within a quarter of a mile."

      "question": "When does the movie take place?",
      "answer": "Although no dates are established, there's an article in one of the dropped newspapers in Trejo's truck during the armored car robbery with the headline \"Business Can Taste Victory on Tort Reform\", which was in the 28 April 1995 issue of The Los Angeles Times. This would mean that the movie starts around the beginning of May 1995. Also, when Chris stays at Neil's house, Neil asks why he's broke with the score they've recently taken, Chris states \"Vegas and Super Bowl cleaned me out.\""

      "question": "After the armored car robbery and shootings, the homeless guy said that someone called a guard \"Slick\", but Cheritto said that to Waingro. Was this an error?",
      "answer": "No. As a matter of fact, this moment in Heat is an accurate portrayal of what can happen with material eyewitnesses and their perception at a crime scene. Example: During a bank robbery, you would have 30 witnesses, all with different versions of the events and all with different descriptions of the robbers. In the armored car robbery, Waingro pistol-whips the first guard in a moment of adrenaline, since the guard is not stepping back when Waingro orders him to do so (for two reasons, one being that they are deafened, and the second being that since Waingro has a hockey mask on, they can't tell who is addressing them). As soon as the guard is pistol-whipped, Cheritto turns to him and tells him, \"Hey, Slick, see that shit (blood) comin' outta their ears? They can't fuckin' hear you! Cool it!\"However, there is a homeless man hiding in an encampment across the street, the guy with the working television, during the whole ordeal, and he overhears this much. He didn't hear the entire conversation or see who was talking to whom, so all that stood out was the word \"slick\", which was likely easy for him to hear because Cheritto is nearly shouting at Waingro. Consequently, that is why Bosko is noting that the homeless man claims that \"someone called a guard 'Slick'\". This simple word, though a long shot, is what tracks Vincent to McCauley's crew after talking with Richard Torena. \"Slick\", as Hanna says, is an alias that will get his team \"the phonebook\" from the FBI, meaning that the FBI and other law enforcement agencies must have that specific word in their records of thousands of times or even more. Hanna wants it checked anyway and in the end it works as a clue, since Richard Torena remembers Cheritto using that word."

      "question": "What types of rifles are used in various scenes?",
      "answer": "In the armored car hold-up, McCauley and Chris Shiherlis () use the \"Colt Commando\", while Michael Cheritto (Tom Sizemore) uses an FN FAL and Trejo (Danny Trejo) uses an \"AKS-47.\" In the shootout at the deserted drive-in movie, Shiherlis uses a Heckler & Koch HK91 while Cheritto uses a Benelli M3 Super 90 shotgun and Neil uses a Heckler & Koch USP pistol. In the bank hold-up, McCauley and Shiherlis again carry the \"Colt Commando\", while Cheritto now carries an Israeli Galil. Hanna's rifle in this scene is the less-known FN FNC, a 5.56mm assault rife that is, in fact, in limited service with some U.S. police agencies. The other police officers aside from Hanna carry a mix of M16A2 assault rifles and Mossberg 590 12-gauge shotguns. Edit"

      "question": "Hugh Benny (Henry Rollins) is referred to as a \"CI\" a few times. What's a CI?",
      "answer": "CI stands for \"confidential informant\", someone who gives the police crime information but who may or may not give their identity to the authorities (Benny does). Benny was ordered to reveal info his boss, Roger Van Zant, had gotten from Trejo about Neil's big heist at the bank. Waingro had gotten the info from Trejo, when he beats Trejo in his own home, with Van Zant watching in a scene that happens offscreen. Benny placed a call to the LAPD and let them know when & where the heist was going to take place, making him a CI."

    {
      "question": "What did Vincent mean when he said to the Captain at the precious metals repository \"I have tactical command that supersedes your rank!\" and let the robbers go?",
      "answer": "Vincent is a lieutenant. Normally he would be outranked by the SWAT team leader, who is a captain. However, because the case is Vincent's, he has ultimate authority over how to proceed, including in the use of the captain's SWAT team, authority that was given to him by either his superior or the SWAT captain's. Their specific disagreement was over whether to arrest Neil and his crew. The captain wanted to arrest them right away. However, since they had not actually taken anything, Vincent knew that all they could arrest them for was a minor breaking and entering charge. Vincent wanted to put the crew away for an extended sentence, specifically for grand theft (had Neil's crew actually taken what they were after at the depository), and with a lengthy sentence dangling over 4 men, there's the likelihood at least one of them would want a plea deal and give up the other crew members for the murder of the armored car guards. Had the SWAT team arrested Neil's crew when they left the depository without actually stealing anything, it would, as Vincent said, get \"knocked back to some chickenshit misdemeanor\" (breaking and entering) charge and they'll be out in 6 months. It might also have the effect of making Neil and his crew even more cautious in the future, stay more alert to the police shadowing them, and harder to catch in the act like they nearly were."

    {
      "question": "Why would Neil be so concerned about Chris' domestic problems? Why does he confront Charlene in the hotel?",
      "answer": "There are two possible motives for Neil. One is that Neil needs Chris to be focused on their work. Chris Shiherlis also has a pretty big gambling problem; when he's talking to Charlene at their house he tells her that he'd \"squared things with the bookies\". At the truck stop, Neil says that everyone's split from the armored car robbery (which he'd gotten from Nate) was in his car. Shiherlis had likely taken his split & paid off his bookies, the people who laid his most recent bets. When he got home, Charlene was angry that the money Chris had brought home wasn't the amount she was expecting, and it leads to a fight between them and Chris storms out.When Neil talks to Chris in the apartment, he asks Chris where all the money from their recent jobs has been going. Chris mutters about Vegas & the Super Bowl which probably means he'd lost a large amount of cash in Las Vegas and had bet another large amount on the big game. So he decided to take most of the money he'd earned on robbery jobs and pay off his bookies. Neil was concerned because if Chris' head isn't in the jobs they're doing, which require very precise work to be done, that one or all of those jobs would fail because Chris could slip-up, giving the police information to track them. So he talks to Charlene, very harshly, about her affair with Alan Marciano and about giving Chris a 2nd chance. She agrees, especially since Neil promises to take care of herself and their son if Chris screws up again, and Charlene wants to leave him.The other possible motive is much simpler: that Neil and Chris (and the rest of the team) really are friends. After Michael Cherrito dies in the shootout and Neil talks about it with Eady he tries to talk tough and to act like he doesn't care about it but he still refers to Michael as his friend and seems to be trying to convince himself as much as Eady. He goes through a lot of trouble to keep Chris' marriage together and to watch out for him. When Chris is shot during the shootout Neil risks his life to save him and then continues to put himself in danger by getting him to a doctor. He also tries to meet up with Chris later at Nate's and doesn't seem very happy that Nate let Chris go off on his own.Another thing to consider is that the idea for the movie came from talking to the real life detective, and it is a study of the detective, i.e. the \"Heat\". Neil, as the antithesis of Vincent, has to be shown as having a true commeraderie with his colleagues in order to emphasize that Vincent cannot afford the same."

      "question": "Were Pacino and De Niro ever in the same scene together?",
      "answer": "Yes. Many viewers claim that (Neil McCauley) and Al Pacino (Lt Vince Hanna) never (or hardly ever) actually share screen time during the film, despite the hype surrounding the film's release as showcasing their first screen appearances together. In most Pan and Scan versions of the film, and TV broadcasts, it does appear that during the \"diner scene\" the two never actually share the screen, but viewing the film in widescreen clearly shows both actors sitting at the table. They were also in the final scenes of the film together, and it's clear that they're both in the same frame. Edit"

      "question": "Is it true that the robbers of the North Hollywood shootout were inspired by the climactic shootout in 'Heat'?",
      "answer": "The North Hollywood shootout was a gunfight between police and two armed robbers in the North Hollywood neighborhood. On February 28th, 1997, two men—Larry Phillips, Jr. and Emil Matasareanu—robbed the Bank of America branch located at 6600 Laurel Canyon Boulevard, North Hollywood, California, and were killed after a 44-minute battle with police. They had reportedly watched the movie Heat, and a used copy of the film was found in their apartment."

There are no major difference between these versions.

      "question": "Which deleted scenes are included in the two-disc special edition that didn't make the final cut?",
      "answer": "The two-disc \"Special Edition\" Warner release of Heat (which replaces an earlier bare-bones disc released in 1999) contains 11 deleted scenes on its Disc Two. These include (in order of which they would appear):1. \"Season's Starting Early\" (00:32): Cheritto purchases hockey masks for the armored car robbery as well as a dollhouse for his daughter, falling in with the scenes of Neil stealing the ambulance and Shiherlis buying explosives.2. \"Nicest Guy on the Block\" (00:39): Cheritto arriving back at his domestic hearth, playing with his kids, giving his wife Elaine (Susan Traylor) a packet of money, and then looking mysteriously dazed.3. \"Albert and Hanna\" (00:18): An alternate and expanded take of Hanna's conversation with Albert Torena (Ricky Harris).4. \"Shakedown\" (00:27): Hanna and Sergeant Drucker try rattling the cages by pressing a shady TV repairman named Cuzomano. Cuzomano is mentioned in the movie at the scene of the armored car robbery, when Hanna is assigning detectives the names of fences to interrogate.5. \"Murder in C Block\" (00:34): An expanded version of the dialogue between Hanna and Richard Torena (Tone Loc), where Richard provides more detail to Hanna on how \"I could get killed for telling you this sh**!\" with the effect of illustrating Cheritto's ruthlessness, even behind bars.6. \"Let's Dance\" (00:45): Expanded restaurant scene between Hanna and his wife Justine (Diane Venora), dancing and talking about how they got married in the first place.7. \"Late Arrival\" (00:38): Expansive of McCauley's crew discussing how they got made, with Cheritto arriving late, showing the transponders used to monitor his car, and making a guess as to how the cops got on to them (dialogue elsewhere in the movie confirms the suspicion voiced in this deleted bit).8: \"Where's Ana?\" (02:19) The scene begins with Breedan dropping the crew off in front of the bank, with Neil informing Breedan that there will be no police response time, as they've bypassed the alarm. We then see Trejo arriving at his hillside house. He finds several of Van Zant's men, including Hugh Benny and Waingro, waiting for him inside. We learn that he has been blackmailed into betraying Neil. Benny then makes a phone call to the police, to send the police to the bank and spark the shootout. Trejo throughout the scene constantly asks for his wife's whereabouts. It then dawns on him, and he runs into the next room, followed by Waingro, wielding a baseball bat. This is considered the most telling of the deleted scenes. It is implied that the ending of the scene might have been intended to fade in to McCauley and the crew carrying out the bank robbery.9. \"Double the Worst Trouble\" (00:41): A slightly extended version of the scene between Neil and the shady Doctor Bob (Jeremy Piven), who tries to squeeze him for a bigger fee.10. \"Nate Delivers\" (01:12): Newly informative scene between Neil and Nate going over Neil's new \"out\" that Nate's prepared for him.11. \"No Response\" (00:18): Extraneous shot of Neil getting into the car with a catatonic Eady (Amy Brennamen)."

      "question": "Why would Waingro climb into the tow truck (on the way to the first heist) without gloves on, thus leaving his fingerprints on the door?",
      "answer": "As Waingro says \"I'm a cowboy. Looking for anything heavy.\". Essentially he's a psychopath that loves violence and carnage with very little regard for himself or anyone else, which is also why he guns down a defenseless guard. It's also possible that they could have wiped down the truck while waiting for the armored car to arrive, as Waingro's gear was in the truck with Cheritto -- Michael could have easily passed him a rag or something similar and told him to wipe down any spot on the truck he touched with his bare hands. It's also possible that the reason Waingro was hired for the job was because they simply needed an extra man for crowd control. So they hired Waingro through a contact. Since he had never met the team before, had he gotten caught, there's very little information he could give about Neil and the crew. However, once Waingro killed the guard and put them all on the hook for first degree murder, he became a major liability and had to be killed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would someone as professional and cautious as Neil hire a total stranger like Waingro for his crew?",
      "answer": "The most probable explanation is that Neil believed that the job required an extra man. Three men to control the three guards (who would have been armed, initially), one man to grab the bonds, and a getaway driver. The odd thing is that Waingro seems to have never met the crew as he and Mike had never met each other. Neil probably went to a contact he trusted (Nate) about hiring an extra man for the job. Once they had Waingro, Neil had likely met with him beforehand (as Waingro seemed to know how tight the crew was with each other) and explained the job to him. I.e. \"You'll meet up with my guy Mike. You'll be in the tow truck that'll be used to ram the armoured car. After that you'll just be crowd control. Keep the guards from doing anything stupid.\" That's really all the job details Waingro would need. This would also limit the crew's exposure if Waingro was a snitch or undercover cop. Having not met the rest of the crew or had explicit details about the job that he could divulge to the police, Waingro could be cut loose of the crew if need be. Also possible Neil and crew would use Waingro as a scapegoat and all agree to give up Waingro as the mastermind if they were to all be apprehended. Possibly giving them reduced sentences, and keeping their main crew intact. Though that may still be considered ratting and strongly frowned upon in their line of work.Unfortunately, the lack of vetting on Waingro kept Neil blind to the fact that Waingro was a psychopath that was on the job more for the opportunity to kill someone and put them all at risk."

    {
      "question": "How were Neil's crew able to dump all of Vincent's unit's surveillance at the same time?",
      "answer": "In the scene where Neil meets with Nate (Jon Voight) and Nate passes on the info he was able to collect on Vincent and his unit, Nate says very quickly that Neil and his guys have been bugged. Nate doesn't go into to very much detail but Neil is professional and knowledgeable enough to assume that it means their phones are tapped, their homes are being watched and their vehicles have all been lowjacked and perhaps more. Nate also mentions that he has at least one connection in the LAPD -- a corrupted officer or other official -- that gave him the info on Vincent and his team as well as their surveillance methods.Neil and his crew would have coordinated with each other. Found all the trackers and surveillance watching them. Once they had found all these items and spotted which police were watching them, they likely all had a set time to dump it all. I.e. \"at 10pm sharp, we all dump everything.\". Meaning they swap cars with ones that wouldn't be traced, which would allow them to get away from police visually surveilling them and they would also leave behind any cell phones, beepers or any other electronical equipment that the police would have bugged. Then the crew all meet at a pre-discussed hideout until the job is complete."

Cheritto was killed during the robbery, therefore assuming the bags each had an equal amount of cash in them, his third was seized by the police. However Neil and Chris escape the main shootout each with their bags of cash. Neil went to get Chris, but he had already left; assuming they both kept their shares, then Chris got away with his share.

    {
      "question": "Because Shiherlis never showed up to be apprehended by the cops, would Charlene go to jail?",
      "answer": "No. The police, Sgt Drucker specifically, offer Charlene a deal: she \"helps\" the police by calling her husband and getting him to show up at the apartment to be arrested. Drucker offered Charlene immunity so she could start a new life with her son Dominick. Drucker explains that Dominick is in danger of entering the \"system\" if he becomes an orphan and it may lead him to a life of crime and incarceration, specifically mentioning two of California's most famous max security prisons at the towns of Chino and Tracy. If Charlene refuses to give Chris up, the police will charge her with being an accessory to Chris' crimes and she will go to jail and lose their son. At the safe house, Charlene gives Chris a signal so he can get away - a very risky move on her part since the police appear to be watching her very closely - but the police do not see the signal. As far as they know she was making good on her deal to help them, and he just didn't show. Therefore they have no reason to revoke their deal. They probably just assumed that he wouldn't risk coming for her and left her behind. Additionally, Chris had cut his hair very short to disguise himself and had false ID made up in the interim between when Neil left him and when he left Nate's house. It is also reasonable to guess that even if Drucker suspected her of warning off Chris that he would not actually \"victimize Dominick\" as he had threatened to do. And without being able to charge Chris for the crime it would be difficult to convict her of being an accessory to it."

The officer who is shot in the chest by Neil in the grocery store parking lot is unclear. Though it looks like he was shot in the heart, he may have survived, as he was likely wearing body armour. The officers behind the police car roadblock most likely do survive. There is a black officer with a shotgun who gets shot by Neil, but is then seen pulling another wounded officer behind a police car for safety. The only officer who definitely was killed was Bosko, and he probably was the only police casualty resulting from the shootout, since his pictures is the only one displayed on the news, and the other officers were either just severely wounded or had bullets stopped by body armor."

    {
      "question": "If Breedan was monitoring the police scanner in the getaway car why didn't he pick up on Vincent organising the roadblock via walkie talkie?",
      "answer": "Presumably, Hanna knew that Neil habitually monitored police frequencies, since undoubtedly, in the forensics investigation into the armored car robbery, they found remains of the police scanners in the ambulance (and would probably have assumed that he did so anyway given how well prepared and technically adroit Neil's crew had proven to be). Therefore he would have used encrypted frequencies within his team and possibly employed cell phones to contact the patrol units (in addition to just grabbing whatever uniformed officers were present in the police station when the information came in). Once the shooting starts, the dispatcher's center would have been flooded with 9-1-1 calls leaving Neil's crew no choice but to quickly blast their way out before the essentially endless stream of police reinforcements overwhelm them (we see additional officers start arriving as Hanna chases Neil and the wounded Shiherlis into the parking lot)."

      "question": "What happens to the key players in the story?",
      "answer": "The ThievesNeil McCauley escapes the final robbery with Chris Shiherlis. While heading to his new escape route with his girlfriend Eady, Nate calls him to tell him that Neil is in the clear. Nate is also compelled to tell Neil where Waingro was hiding. Neil decides to settle the score with Waingro. As Neil is heading back to his car where Eady is waiting for him, he sees Hanna walking towards him. Neil hesitates, but then decides to leave Eady behind to escape on his own. Hanna chases him into an airfield and Neil gets the drop on Hanna. Fortunately for Hanna, he sees Neil's shadow projected from the lights of a plane, and in a split second decision, Hanna turns his pistol and puts four rounds in Neil. As Neil lies there dying, Hanna approaches him, Neil says \"Told you I'm never going back (to prison)\". Neil offers his hand, and Hanna clutches it and waits with Neil as he dies.Chris Shiherlis is shot in the clavicle by Det. Casals during the shootout, he and Neil escape the scene in a stolen car after Neil fires several suppressive bursts on Hanna and a few other cops. Neil then takes Chris to a trusted doctor to get patched up. Chris insists on going to get his wife and child, but Neil tries to convince Chris that the police are anticipating that and will have a trap set up for him. Chris ignores this and goes for Charlene. She appears on a balcony to him but gives him a signal that it's a trap. So Chris plays it off as asking for directions to someone on the street. He is stopped by the police, but he has a fake I.D. and the car he drove hadn't been reported as stolen, so they let him go. He then drives off with his share of the money, alone.Michael Cheritto is separated from Neil and Chris during the shootout. As he is escaping he trips and falls into a fountain, allowing Hanna time to draw a bead on him. When Michael gets up he grabs a young girl near the fountain and uses her as a human shield while firing at the other cops, unable to notice Hanna behind him. When he turns, he barely has time to react before Hanna shoots him in the head, killing him instantly.Donald Breedan is hit by gunfire while driving the getaway car towards the roadblock. It appears he was shot in the head and dies at the scene.Trejo calls Neil shortly before the final bank heist was supposed to happen saying that the police were all over him and he couldn't shake them. He then says to Neil that the last thing he wanted to do was let him down. He wasn't present for the final bank heist, so Neil deduces that it was Trejo who ratted them out to the police. Neil goes into Trejo's house (likely with the intention of killing him) to find Trejo's wife beaten to death and Trejo also horribly injured, and barely alive. Neil asks Trejo why he betrayed them; Trejo reveals that they forced him to because they were holding his wife hostage (this can be viewed in a deleted scene). He tells Neil it was Waingro and Van Zant who were responsible before asking Neil to put him out of his misery. Neil obliges by shooting him.Nate, though not a thief, is a broker and friend of Neil's. Unless any of the ensuing chaos could be traced back to him, which it is implied it didn't, he was free and clear. Given that Nate is such a valuable connection with a lot of experience in the criminal world, he probably knew a million ways not to be implicated in these types of underworld deals.In other scripts it shows Vincent Hanna and 2 of his officers arrest Nate the Fence after he for the last time talked to Neil McCauley.Cesar Kelso, the mastermind of the bank heist. Neil buys the information to the bank from him.Charlene Shiherlis: See the question Because Shiherlis never showed up to be apprehended by the cops, would Charlene go to jail?The Crooks:Waingro, after learning that Neil and Chris escaped the bank robbery, he goes to hide out in a hotel under the name \"Jameson.\" Nate tells this to Neil, as Nate has a friend inside the LAPD who is staking out the hotel in case Neil makes a move on Waingro. Neil decides that he needs to settle the score with Waingro, so he infiltrates the hotel dressed as a security guard, bypasses all the police and security, breaks into Waingro's room and executes Waingro by shooting him twice in the chest and once in the head (a la the Mozambique Drill).Roger Van Zant: Neil goes to Van Zant's home, throws a patio chair through Van Zant's window while Van Zant is watching a hockey game, startling him. Neil aims his gun at Van Zandt and demands to know where Waingro is hiding. Roger replies \"How the hell would I know?\" so Neil shoots him three times in the chest.Hugh Benny: The cops find out that he is the one who ratted the bank heist to the police, so Vincent and his team storm Benny's apartment. When Benny tries to resist, Vincent shoves him through his balcony door and proceeds to interrogate him. So he was likely arrested unless Vincent agreed to let him go if he gave up all the players.Alan Marciano: Agrees to set Charlene up in order to have charges against him dropped. He follows through, so he was likely released.The CopsVincent Hanna: Catches his wife cheating on him, finds his step-daughter in his bath tub near-death due to her attemping suicide by cutting her wrists. Essentially his personal life has completely derailed, but by the end of the film he had caught or killed the criminals he was after, and seeing as how he was a career person more than a family person, he would likely get through it.Sgt. Drucker is last seen with Charlene, but we presume he continues working for Hanna.Schwartz is shot in the shoulder by Cheritto during the bank robbery while firing from beside an LACMTA bus. He gets patched up and stays in the Robbery/Homicide office while the team try to net Neil and Chris. Earlier scripts had Schwartz being the detective killed in the shootout instead of Bosko (Ted Levine's character).Bosko is part of the initial exchange of gunfire with Shiherlis during the bank robbery shootout. He is killed when Shiherlis shoots him in the neck.Casals stays in the robbery/homicide office with Schwartz except to help Vincent apprehend Hugh Benny."
