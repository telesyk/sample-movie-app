      "question": "Why did Black Widow dye her hair blonde in this film?",
      "answer": "Because Black Widow, Captain America, Falcon and Scarlett Witch were all in hiding since the end of Civil War. Black Widow was well-recognized with her bright red hair. So dying it a different colour would help her keep a low profile."

      "question": "What are the Infinity Stones?",
      "answer": "As Wong says, \"The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence: Space, Reality, Power, Soul, Mind, and Time.\"In order of first appearance in the MCU:The Space Stone (blue) - housed in the Tesseract, which appeared post-credits in . In Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), the Red Skull steals the Tesseract and uses it to power weaponry. After transporting the Red Skull to Vormir, the Tesseract falls into the Arctic Ocean where it is later recovered by Howard Stark and taken to a secret base. In 1989, Dr. Wendy Lawson tries to use the Tesseract to unlock light-speed travel. In Captain Marvel (2019), it is recovered by Carol Danvers, who hands it over to S.H.I.E.L.D. In The Avengers (2012), it is shown to be capable of generating wormholes; Loki steals the Tesseract from S.H.I.E.L.D. and uses it to transport the Chitauri to New York City. After the battle, the Tesseract it is returned to Asgard and used to repair the Bifrost. Loki steals the Tesseract before Asgard's destruction in Thor: Ragnarok (2017). He gives it to Thanos in Avengers: Infinity War to save Thor's life. Thanos then crushes the Tesseract to acquire the Stone.Mind Stone (yellow): Housed in a scepter which Thanos and the Other gave to Loki to help him conquer Earth; it allowed him to control people's minds and project energy blasts. After Loki's defeat, the scepter fell into the hands of Wolfgang von Strucker, who in the mid-credits scene of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) is seen using it to experiment on humans; these experiments produced Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. In Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), the scepter is revealed to contain the Mind Stone and has an AI that grants sentience to Ultron, who steals the scepter, removes the Stone from it, and uses it to create a newly upgraded body for himself. The Avengers steal the body from Ultron and upload J.A.R.V.I.S. into it, giving birth to \"Vision\".The Mind Stone can also enhance the user's intelligence, grants the user immense knowledge, and can create new life. In Infinity War, Vision is injured by Thanos' children trying to get the Mind Stone and is taken to Wakanda to have it removed. Scarlet Witch is forced to destroy Vision and the Stone, only for Thanos to use the Time Stone to revive Vision and collect it, killing Vision again.Reality Stone (red): Transformed into a fluid-like weapon called the Aether, it first appears in Thor: The Dark World (2013), where Malekith attempts to use it to destroy the Nine Realms. Jane Foster becomes infected by the Aether, and it is later drawn out of her by Malekith. After Malekith is defeated by Thor, Sif and Volstagg seal the Aether in a lantern-like container and entrust it to the Collector in order to separate it from the Tesseract. The Aether, when bonded with a host, can turn anything into dark matter, and is capable of sucking the life force out of humans and other mortals. It can also create portals to other worlds, disrupt the laws of physics, and repel threats if it senses any. In Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos acquires the Aether/Reality Stone from the Collector.Power Stone (purple): Housed in an orb that Ronan seeks for Thanos in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), it can increase the user's strength and destroy entire civilizations with a single blast. After Star-Lord finds and steals it from its hiding place, Ronan takes it back. After betraying Thanos, Ronan tries to use it to destroy the planet Xandar but is stopped and defeated by the Ravagers, Nova Corps, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. Due to his half-Celestial heritage, Star-Lord is able to withstand the Stone's power, particularly when the burden is shared by the other Guardians. Star-Lord kills Ronan with an energy blast from the Stone and then places it a new orb and entrusts it to the Nova Corps. Before the events of Infinity War, the Power Stone is the first to be obtained by Thanos, who \"decimates\" Xandar in the process, a scene not shown in the series as yet.Time Stone (green): Housed in the Eye of Agamotto by Earth's first sorcerer, Agamotto. A Master of the Mystic Arts can use the Stone to alter and manipulate time. In Doctor Strange (2016), the title character finds the Eye and uses it to defeat Dormammu. Strange returns the Eye to the Masters of the Mystic Arts' secret compound Kamar-Taj, but is seen wearing it again in the mid-credits scene. During the events of Avengers: Infinity War, Thanos's lieutenants attempt to steal the Eye from Strange (who has locked it in the Eye with a simple but unbreakable spell) but are foiled by Tony Stark and Peter Parker. While on the planet Titan (Thanos's homeworld), Strange uses the Time Stone to look into future timelines, viewing millions of possible outcomes of their conflict with Thanos and sees only one future where they win. Strange later surrenders the Stone to Thanos to save Tony Stark. During the confrontation in Wakanda, Thanos uses the Time Stone to undo the Mind Stone's destruction.Soul Stone (orange): The Soul Stone has the ability to manipulate a soul and the essence of a person. It is first seen in Avengers: Infinity War. Some time prior to Guardians of the Galaxy, Thanos tasked Gamora with finding the Soul Stone as there is little record of its existence compared to the other Infinity Stones. Gamora found it hidden on the planet Vormir, but decided not to tell Thanos and kept the secret with Nebula (little realizing that Thanos wasn't fooled). After Thanos captures and tortures Nebula, Gamora agrees to take him to Vormir, where they encounter the Red Skull (having been transported to Vormir by the Tesseract), who serves as the Stonekeeper. The Red Skull informs Thanos that he must sacrifice someone he loves to acquire the Stone. Thanos sacrifices Gamora, causing the Stone to appear in his hand. Edit"

      "question": "Why does Thanos want the Infinity Stones?",
      "answer": "Thanos seeks to rid the universe of half it's population. He has long carried on such a campaign because he sees all sentient beings as overcrowding the universe, using up all natural resources too quickly and creating poverty on a massive scale. Problems like poverty and scarcity of resources leads to war. Thanos believes the only way to preserve life is to eliminate half of it.In the scene after Thanos has acquired the Mind stone and arrives on his home planet of Titan, he talks to Dr Strange, telling the sorcerer that Titan was once a \"paradise\" but overpopulation had led to the problems described above. When Thanos offered the rulers of Titan his solution, they considered the plan to be that of a madman and rejected it. Thanos then started his campaign across the universe, though without the stones."

      "question": "How was Thanos able to defeat Hulk so easily in hand to hand combat?",
      "answer": "Thanos is very skilled in hand-to-hand combat, more so than the Hulk, who typically shows little or no skill in that arena. Thanos has been raised to be a ruthless warrior and has learned many different combat techniques and how to use a large array of weapons. All he had to do was let the Hulk beat him for a few moments to figure out the best way to defeat the Hulk. As a result, the Hulk is traumatized and essentially goes into hiding in Banner. Additionally, Thanos already has the Power stone."

      "question": "Doctor Strange saw 14,000,605 possible future scenarios. He didn't say he saw ALL, so why did he stop after viewing 1 in which they won?",
      "answer": "No matter how many futures in which they won, Strange watched, he still would have had to choose only one to make it real and show us. Dr Strange could have watched more futures, but in the end we would have still gotten the same 2 movies. In order for us to see a different future means a different set of films, so 2 more new Avengers movies need be reshot for each future. The Producers have chosen this \"only one possible win\", so that all complaints/questions that arise are aswered with: This was the only way!"

      "question": "In the end credit scene, why does Maria Hill call Fury \"Nick\"?",
      "answer": "She and Fury are close friends and allies who are on first name basis. Furthermore, Maria has called Fury \"Nick\" in several other MCU films. Maria was likely in shock due to the fact she was being dusted away and forgot to call him Fury."

      "question": "Did Luke Cage survive the snap?",
      "answer": "Irrelevant. Seeing as how Luke Cage isn't featured in any of the films and the marvel netflix series were cancelled. Not to mention everyone from the snap is brought back in Endgame."
