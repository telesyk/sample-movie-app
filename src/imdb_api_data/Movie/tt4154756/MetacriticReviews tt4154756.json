      "content": "Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain to set the stakes higher than ever, Avengers: Infinity War successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics."

      "rate": "80",
      "content": "Somehow in its pure uproariousness, it works. It’s just a supremely watchable film, utterly confident in its self-created malleable mythology. And confident also in the note of apocalyptic darkness."

      "rate": "80",
      "content": "The script is surprisingly smart, pulling together all the subplots and cutting among all the locations. Chris Pratt’s Star Lord has some clever lines. Thanos is a far more complex villain than we usually get. And the movie ends on a stark and shocking note."

      "rate": "75",
      "content": "As a virtuoso juggling act, Infinity War has no real parallel in popular culture; as a movie, it’s an impressive montage of greatest hits until the gut punch of a finale."

      "rate": "70",
      "content": "Avengers: Infinity War cares a bit too much about being \"Part 1\" and holding enough development for \"Part 2,\" but MCU fans should see their 10-year buildup expectations met - not exceeded, but met."
