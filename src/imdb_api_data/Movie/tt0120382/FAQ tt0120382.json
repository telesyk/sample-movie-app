      "question": "Why isn't Truman angry at all? After all, he has been cheated for such a long time?",
      "answer": "Because he is an explorer. His mind focuses on discovering the truth instead of dealing with the past. Also, it's not fair to say that he doesn't feel anger - he cries in a great mixture of feelings upon discovering the wall which is the definitive proof that his world is fake. Additionally, after his iconic final bow, he gives the sky a subtle sneer."
