Five percent of the movie's profit were given to Simon de Cyrène, an association that helps paralyzed people.\r\nPlot\r\nAt night in Paris, Driss is driving Philippe's Maserati Quattroporte at high speed. Chased through the streets by the police, they are eventually cornered. Driss claims the quadriplegic Philippe must get to the emergency room urgently; Philippe pretends to have a seizure and the fooled police officers escort them. After arriving at the hospital, Driss drives away.\r\nThe story of friendship between the two men is then told as a flashback: Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic owner of a luxurious hôtel particulier, and his assistant Magalie are interviewing potential live-in caregivers. Driss has no ambitions to get hired; he only attends to get a signature on a document proving his interview was rejected, in order to continue receiving his benefits. He is told to come back the next morning to collect his signed document.\r\nThe next day when Driss returns, Philippe's aide Yvonne greets him, telling him he has the job on a trial basis. Despite being uninterested and inexperienced, he does well caring for Philippe, albeit using unconventional methods. Driss learns the extent of his employer’s disability, aiding Philippe in every aspect of his life. A friend of Philippe's reveals that Driss was imprisoned for six months for robbery, but Philippe does not care about Driss's past. As Driss is the only one who does not treat Philippe with pity, he will not fire Driss as long as he does his job properly.\r\nPhilippe explains his disability resulted from a paragliding incident and that his wife died without bearing children. Gradually, Driss helps him to organise his private life, including disciplining his precocious adopted daughter Elisa. Driss discovers modern art, opera and starts painting. For Philippe's birthday, a private classical music concert is performed in his living room. Philippe educates Driss on famous classical pieces, but Driss only recognizes them as advert music or cartoon themes. Feeling the concert is too boring, Driss plays Earth, Wind & Fire's \"Boogie Wonderland\", livening up the party, with the guests also enjoying the music.\r\nDiscovering Philippe has a purely epistolary relationship with a woman called Eléonore who lives in Dunkirk, Driss encourages his employer to meet her, but Philippe fears her reaction when she discovers his disability. Driss persuades him to talk to her by phone. Philippe agrees to send a photo of himself in a wheelchair to her, but he hesitates and asks his aide, Yvonne, to send a picture as he was before his accident. A date between them is agreed to, but at the last minute Philippe is too scared to meet Eléonore and leaves with Yvonne before she arrives. Philippe then calls Driss, inviting him to fly with him in his Dassault Falcon 900 private jet for a paragliding weekend in the Alps.\r\nDriss's cousin, Adam, in trouble with a gang, comes to fetch Driss at the mansion on the pretext of delivering mail. Overhearing, Philippe recognizes Driss's need to be supportive to his family and releases him from his job, suggesting he may not want to push a wheelchair all his life.\r\nDriss returns home, joins his friends and manages to help his cousin. In the meantime new caregivers have replaced Driss but Philippe is not happy with any of them. His morale is very low and he stops taking care of himself. He grows a beard and looks ill. Worried, Yvonne calls Driss back.\r\nUpon arrival Driss drives Philippe in the Maserati, which brings the story back to the initial police chase. After they elude the police, Driss takes Philippe to the seaside. Once Philippe has shaved and dressed, they arrive at a Cabourg restaurant on the sea front. Driss suddenly leaves the table, saying good luck to Philippe on his lunch date. A few seconds later Eléonore arrives. Emotionally touched, Philippe looks through the window and sees Driss outside, smiling at him. Driss bids Philippe farewell and walks away as Phillipe and Eléonore chat and enjoy each other's company.\r\nThe film ends with shots of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Sellou, the people on whom the story is based, together on a hillside, reminiscent of the paragliding scene earlier in the film. The closing caption states that the men remain close friends to this day.\r\nSetting\r\nThe plot of the film is inspired by the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his French-Algerian caregiver Abdel Sellou, discovered by the directors in À la vie, à la mort, a documentary film.\r\nCast\r\nFrançois Cluzet as Philippe\r\nOmar Sy as Bakary \"Driss\" Bassari\r\nAudrey Fleurot as Magalie\r\nAnne Le Ny as Yvonne\r\nClotilde Mollet as Marcelle\r\nAlba Gaïa Bellugi as Elisa\r\nJoséphine de Meaux as Nathalie Lecomte\r\nCyril Mendy as Adama, Driss's cousin\r\nChristian Ameri as Albert\r\nGrégoire Oestermann as Antoine\r\nMarie-Laure Descoureaux as Chantal\r\nAbsa Dialou Toure as Mina\r\nSalimata Kamate as Fatou\r\nThomas Soliveres as Bastien\r\nDorothée Brière-Meritte as Éléonore\r\nCaroline Bourg as Fred\r\nÉmilie Caen as The gallerist\r\nReception\r\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics and holds a 75% approval rating at the film review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 122 reviews, and an average score of 6.7/10. The consensus states, \"It handles its potentially prickly subject matter with kid gloves, but Intouchables gets by thanks to its strong cast and some remarkably sensitive direction.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 31 ratings of professional critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.\r\nCritical response in the UK\r\nThe film divided critics in the UK. Upon the film's 21 September 2012 UK release under the title Untouchable, The Independent called it \"a third-rate buddy movie that hardly understands its own condescension....Why has the world flipped for this movie? Maybe it's the fantasy it spins on racial/social/cultural mores, much as Driving Miss Daisy did 20-odd years ago – uptight rich white employer learns to love through black employee's life-force. That was set in the segregationist America of the 1940s. What's this film's excuse?\" Robbie Collin of The Telegraph called it \"as broad, accessible and trombonishly unsubtle as a subtitled Driving Miss Daisy\"; according to Collin, the \"characters are conduits for charisma rather than great dramatic roles, but the horseplay between Sy and Cluzet is often very funny, and one joke bounces merrily into the next.\" Nigel Farndale, also of The Telegraph, said: \"The film, which is about to be released in Britain, has been breaking box-office records in France and Germany, and one of the reasons seems to be that it gives the audience permission to laugh with, not at, people with disabilities, and see their lives as they have never seen them before.\"\r\nAccolades\r\nThe film won the Tokyo Sakura Grand Prix award given to the best film at the Tokyo International Film Festival and the Award for Best Actor to both Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy in 2011. At the César Awards 2012, the film received eight nominations. Omar Sy received the César Award for Best Actor on 24 February 2012 for the role of Driss (defeating Jean Dujardin, nominated for The Artist) and being the first French African actor to receive this honor.\r\nIn September 2012, it was announced that The Intouchables had been selected as the French entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar for the 85th Academy Awards. In December 2012, it made the January shortlist, but was ultimately not selected for inclusion among the final nominees.\r\nBox office\r\nAfter four weeks, by 25 November 2011, The Intouchables had already become the most-watched film in France in 2011. After sixteen weeks, more than 19 million people had seen the film in France.

Both versions star Karthi and Akkineni Nagarjuna as its male leads. They were released on 25 March 2016.\r\nIn 2014, rights to The Intouchables were sold to Bollywood filmmakers Karan Johar and Guneet Monga.

Until it was eclipsed in 2014 by Lucy, it was the most viewed French film in the world with 51.5 million tickets sold. The film received several award nominations. In France, the film won the César Award for Best Actor for Sy and garnered seven further nominations for the César Awards, including the César Award for Best Actor for Cluzet. Five percent of the movie's profit were given to Simon de Cyrène, an association that helps paralyzed people.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>At night in Paris, Driss is driving Philippe's Maserati Quattroporte at high speed. Chased through the streets by the police, they are eventually cornered. Driss claims the quadriplegic Philippe must get to the emergency room urgently; Philippe pretends to have a seizure and the fooled police officers escort them. After arriving at the hospital, Driss drives away.</p><p>The story of friendship between the two men is then told as a flashback: Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic owner of a luxurious hôtel particulier, and his assistant Magalie are interviewing potential live-in caregivers. Driss has no ambitions to get hired; he only attends to get a signature on a document proving his interview was rejected, in order to continue receiving his benefits. He is told to come back the next morning to collect his signed document.</p><p>The next day when Driss returns, Philippe's aide Yvonne greets him, telling him he has the job on a trial basis. Despite being uninterested and inexperienced, he does well caring for Philippe, albeit using unconventional methods. Driss learns the extent of his employer’s disability, aiding Philippe in every aspect of his life. A friend of Philippe's reveals that Driss was imprisoned for six months for robbery, but Philippe does not care about Driss's past. As Driss is the only one who does not treat Philippe with pity, he will not fire Driss as long as he does his job properly.</p><p>Philippe explains his disability resulted from a paragliding incident and that his wife died without bearing children. Gradually, Driss helps him to organise his private life, including disciplining his precocious adopted daughter Elisa. Driss discovers modern art, opera and starts painting. For Philippe's birthday, a private classical music concert is performed in his living room. Philippe educates Driss on famous classical pieces, but Driss only recognizes them as advert music or cartoon themes. Feeling the concert is too boring, Driss plays Earth, Wind & Fire's \"Boogie Wonderland\", livening up the party, with the guests also enjoying the music.</p><p>Discovering Philippe has a purely epistolary relationship with a woman called Eléonore who lives in Dunkirk, Driss encourages his employer to meet her, but Philippe fears her reaction when she discovers his disability. Driss persuades him to talk to her by phone. Philippe agrees to send a photo of himself in a wheelchair to her, but he hesitates and asks his aide, Yvonne, to send a picture as he was before his accident. A date between them is agreed to, but at the last minute Philippe is too scared to meet Eléonore and leaves with Yvonne before she arrives. Philippe then calls Driss, inviting him to fly with him in his Dassault Falcon 900 private jet for a paragliding weekend in the Alps.</p><p>Driss's cousin, Adam, in trouble with a gang, comes to fetch Driss at the mansion on the pretext of delivering mail. Overhearing, Philippe recognizes Driss's need to be supportive to his family and releases him from his job, suggesting he may not want to push a wheelchair all his life.</p><p>Driss returns home, joins his friends and manages to help his cousin. In the meantime new caregivers have replaced Driss but Philippe is not happy with any of them. His morale is very low and he stops taking care of himself. He grows a beard and looks ill. Worried, Yvonne calls Driss back.</p><p>Upon arrival Driss drives Philippe in the Maserati, which brings the story back to the initial police chase. After they elude the police, Driss takes Philippe to the seaside. Once Philippe has shaved and dressed, they arrive at a Cabourg restaurant on the sea front. Driss suddenly leaves the table, saying good luck to Philippe on his lunch date. A few seconds later Eléonore arrives. Emotionally touched, Philippe looks through the window and sees Driss outside, smiling at him. Driss bids Philippe farewell and walks away as Phillipe and Eléonore chat and enjoy each other's company.</p><p>The film ends with shots of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and Abdel Sellou, the people on whom the story is based, together on a hillside, reminiscent of the paragliding scene earlier in the film. The closing caption states that the men remain close friends to this day.</p><br/><h3>Setting</h3><p>The plot of the film is inspired by the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his French-Algerian caregiver Abdel Sellou, discovered by the directors in À la vie, à la mort, a documentary film.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>François Cluzet as Philippe</li><li>Omar Sy as Bakary \"Driss\" Bassari</li><li>Audrey Fleurot as Magalie</li><li>Anne Le Ny as Yvonne</li><li>Clotilde Mollet as Marcelle</li><li>Alba Gaïa Bellugi as Elisa</li><li>Joséphine de Meaux as Nathalie Lecomte</li><li>Cyril Mendy as Adama, Driss's cousin</li><li>Christian Ameri as Albert</li><li>Grégoire Oestermann as Antoine</li><li>Marie-Laure Descoureaux as Chantal</li><li>Absa Dialou Toure as Mina</li><li>Salimata Kamate as Fatou</li><li>Thomas Soliveres as Bastien</li><li>Dorothée Brière-Meritte as Éléonore</li><li>Caroline Bourg as Fred</li><li>Émilie Caen as The gallerist</li></ul><br/><h3>Reception</h3><p>The film received mostly positive reviews from critics and holds a 75% approval rating at the film review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 122 reviews, and an average score of 6.7/10. The consensus states, \"It handles its potentially prickly subject matter with kid gloves, but Intouchables gets by thanks to its strong cast and some remarkably sensitive direction.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 31 ratings of professional critics. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale.</p><h4>Critical response in the UK</h4><p>The film divided critics in the UK. Upon the film's 21 September 2012 UK release under the title Untouchable, The Independent called it \"a third-rate buddy movie that hardly understands its own condescension....Why has the world flipped for this movie? Maybe it's the fantasy it spins on racial/social/cultural mores, much as Driving Miss Daisy did 20-odd years ago – uptight rich white employer learns to love through black employee's life-force. That was set in the segregationist America of the 1940s. What's this film's excuse?\" Robbie Collin of The Telegraph called it \"as broad, accessible and trombonishly unsubtle as a subtitled Driving Miss Daisy\"; according to Collin, the \"characters are conduits for charisma rather than great dramatic roles, but the horseplay between Sy and Cluzet is often very funny, and one joke bounces merrily into the next.\" Nigel Farndale, also of The Telegraph, said: \"The film, which is about to be released in Britain, has been breaking box-office records in France and Germany, and one of the reasons seems to be that it gives the audience permission to laugh with, not at, people with disabilities, and see their lives as they have never seen them before.\"</p><h4>Accolades</h4><p>The film won the Tokyo Sakura Grand Prix award given to the best film at the Tokyo International Film Festival and the Award for Best Actor to both Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy in 2011. At the César Awards 2012, the film received eight nominations. Omar Sy received the César Award for Best Actor on 24 February 2012 for the role of Driss (defeating Jean Dujardin, nominated for The Artist) and being the first French African actor to receive this honor.</p><p>In September 2012, it was announced that The Intouchables had been selected as the French entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar for the 85th Academy Awards. In December 2012, it made the January shortlist, but was ultimately not selected for inclusion among the final nominees.</p><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><caption>List of awards and nominations</caption><tbody><tr><th>Award</th><th>Category</th><th>Recipients and nominees</th><th>Result</th></tr><tr><td><span>African-American Film Critics Association</span></td><td>Best Foreign Film</td><th></th><td style=\"background: #9EFF9E;
