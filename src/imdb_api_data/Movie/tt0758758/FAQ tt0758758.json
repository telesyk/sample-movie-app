      "question": "Is 'Into the Wild' based on a book?",
      "answer": "Into the Wild (1996) is a biography of Christopher McCandless, written by American writer and mountaineer Jon Krakauer. The book is an expansion of \"Death of an Innocent\", an article also by Jon Krakauer that appeared in the January 1993 issue of Outside."
    },
    {
      "question": "How closely does the movie follow the book?",
      "answer": "Those who have both seen the movie and read the book generally conclude that the movie has \"Hollywoodized\" the novel. Arguably, however, the book's implicit (and often explicit) approval of and admiration for Chris McCandless's actions was balanced in the movie with his focused shortcomings to create a more sympathetic and realistic character and to provide the emotional arc of the narrative. While most of the events in the two media are similar, the tone and texture of each is unique."
    },
    {
      "question": "When is the film set?",
      "answer": "McCandless's odyssey began in May 1990 and ended in August 1992."
