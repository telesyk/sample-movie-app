      "question": "When Narcissa Malfoy was checking to see if Harry was dead, why was she whispering under her breath to her son, Draco, asking if Harry was dead or not?",
      "answer": "When she knelt down over Harry she could tell he was still alive because of reasons revealed later in the movie. Her question was to Harry asking him if Draco was still alive. That's why Harry nodded yes. It's at this point that her loyalties to Voldemort began to waver, so she lied and told him Harry was dead."

      "question": "Is 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2' based on a book?",
      "answer": "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007) is the final book of the Harry Potter series, written by British author J.K. Rowling. The novel was adapted for the movie by American screenwriter Steve Kloves. The movie was preceded by (2001), Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002) (2002), Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) (2004), Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005) (2005), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) (2007), Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009) (2009), and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010) (2010).

    {
      "question": "What is the reason for splitting the book into two movies?",
      "answer": "Although producers thought of splitting the each of movie in the series into two parts, the books were adapted to movies mainly by deleting certain characters and subplots that served as background and were not critical to the plot. The makers felt that this was impossible for Deathly Hallows, as most of the subplots and trivial characters are eventually tied to the conclusion. Also, to give the series and each character's story a proper closure, the producers felt that they should not even try to cram all that information into a single film so the decision of a two-parter was made. Also, if they would have made it into one film to fit in the details needed, it would be nearly six hours long."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many horcruxes are left in this film?",
      "answer": "Voldemort split his soul into eight pieces, creating seven horcruxes (the eighth part being his own soul). In the previous movies, Harry, Ron and Dumbledore destroyed three horcruxes: Tom Riddle's Diary (in Chamber of Secrets), the Gaunt's ring (in Half-Blood Prince), and Salazar Slytherin's locket (in Deathly Hallows: Part 1). That brings the total amount of the remaining horcruxes to four. Before, it had been referred to as there being six horcruxes and a seventh thing which Voldemort's soul was hidden in that Harry must discover, as Dumbledore thought Harry would not be able to handle the fact that he himself was a horcrux."

    {
      "question": "How does romance play its part in this film?",
      "answer": "We already know of Harry's romance with Ginny Weasley () as well as the romance budding between Ron and Hermione. However, little time is spent dwelling on how this grows in the actual film. Also, the film deviates from the book by suggesting a romance between Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) and Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch). Rowling has previously described Luna's future lovelife, which does not involve Neville; so in other interviews the Luna-Neville romance is explained as a \"summer fling\" in order to remain canonical.

      "question": "Who is the other guy with Draco and Goyle in the Room of Requirement? Where is Crabbe?",
      "answer": ", the actor who played Crabbe, was arrested for marijuana possession in 2009. Unable to reprise his role, Waylett's character Crabbe was written out of the final film. In the book, it is actually Crabbe who uses fiendfyre in the Room of Requirement and dies because he is unable to control it. The screenwriters changed this to Gregory Goyle (Josh Herdman) for the film. Blaise Zabini (Louis Cordice) is the other Slytherin student who accompanies Draco and Goyle in the Room of Requirement. He appears occasionally in Half-Blood Prince. Edit"

    {
      "question": "How did the person who cast the doe patronus know how to find Harry in the previous film?",
      "answer": "In Deathly Hallows: Part 1, a silver doe patronus leads Harry to the hidden Sword of Gryffindor. In this film, we find out that the patronus belonged to Professor Severus Snape (). In the book, Snape discovers Harry's location because Hermione has a portrait of Phineas Nigellus Black in her bag. The trio frequently had discussions with Phineas, who also had a portrait hanging in the Headmaster's Office in Hogwarts. After overhearing the trio mention their whereabouts, Phineas told Snape. Without Phineas in the films, there is no obvious way for Snape to have found Harry. It is suggested that Aberforth Dumbledore (Ciarán Hinds) gave Snape the information. Right before Harry sees the silver doe in the forest, he is looking into the mirror shard that Aberforth used to watch over Harry. Presumably, Aberforth recognized Harry's location and notified Snape. This would be unlikely as it would cast either Aberforth as a turncoat or would imply that against all logic he knew Snape's secret. Another explanation could be that Snape heard about Ron's capture and subsequent escape from the Snatchers; perhaps he had secretly put a Tracking spell on Ron, enabled his escape, and when realizing that Ron was about to find Harry and Hermione through his Deluminator, sent his Patronus for both Ron and Harry to see. This explanation depends of course on Snape's ability to find out about Ron's capture and secretly putting an undetectable Trace on him. It is even conceivable that the Deluminator itself can be traced; Dumbledore's portrait could have told Snape how to do this. A third possibility is suggested by the book, where a Patronus charm can be used as a messenger; Arthur Weasley sends one to Ron while he hides in Grimmauld Place, without knowing that Ron would be there. It suggests that either Arthur sent his Patronus to all possible hiding locations or that a Patronus can be sent out to search a particular person. Snape might have done the same by intentionally directing his Patronus to Harry without knowing the location. This explanation depends on the possibility that a Patronus could be used as such. If this is the case, it is no ordinary display of magic, because it would enable any wizard to find another person, by simply sending out a Patronus. Perhaps Snape's highly developed talent for Legilimency was also helpful? Edit"

    {
      "question": "Isn't the Elder Wand supposed to be immune from Priori Incantatem (the thing where Harry and Voldemort's wands connect to each other)?",
      "answer": "Priori Incantatem is not simply connecting beams of spells. It is rare magic that occurs when brother wands are forced to battle, while it does result in the charms fired connecting, it also results in a dome of light surrounding the two duelling wizards (in the books it also moves them away from the crowd of Deatheaters). There is a point that the spells meet, and when this is pushed back into either wand, it will force echoes of that wand's previous spells to appear. This only happens once in the entire series of 8 movies: When Voldemort duels Harry in the graveyard in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Remember that Harry's wand with the core of the Phoenix feather was identical to Voldemort's, as mentioned in the first book and movie, the wand chooses the wizard, and because it turns out that Harry had a fragment of Voldemort's soul, they ended up with \"twin wands\". (Voldemort used his wand to kill Cedric Diggory, Frank Bryce (the Muggle caretaker of the Riddle house), and James and Lily Potter and echoes of these people come out of Voldemort's wand and help Harry escape.) What has confused people, is that in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, an artistic decision was made to have the Dumbledore & Voldemort duel appear more visually impressive and take advantage of the scene being shot in IMAX by having the lava-like connection of spells (such a connection does not occur in the books). This was not priori incantatem. But the effect has remained in the following movies. The key difference being that there is no dome of light, and no echoes being forced from wands due to the meeting point of spells being forced into one of the wands. The only instance of a spell being forced into a wand is in the instance of the start of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 when Voldemort uses Lucius Malfoy's wand, and the wand is destroyed. This was not Priori Incantatem either. Harry does not cast a spell, the wand acts of its own accord (Harry is prone in pain), and destroys Lucius's wand. In the final duel, it is not priori incantatem either, the Elder Wand is refusing to kill its master, Harry, and the avada kedavra curse backfires on Voldemort. Shortly after the novel-release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, J.K Rowling revealed that the core of the Elder Wand was a Thestral tail hair, and the Elder Wand was the only wand in the world that had that kind of core, and because of that the Elder Wand can't create Priori Incantatem with any other wand, because there is no \"twin wand\"."

    {
      "question": "Where is the third Hallow, the Invisibility Cloak?",
      "answer": "Harry already has it, because it is the Invisibility Cloak originally given to him by Professor Dumbledore () in the first film. The book explains that it was probably created by Ignotus Peverell, one of the three brothers mentioned in The Tales of Beedle the Bard as the original owners of the three Deadly Hallows. The Cloak was passed onto his descendants and ended up in the hands of Harry's father, and finally Harry, as the last of Ignotus' blood line. The Cloak has an absolute invisibility, which does not wear out over time (like common invisibility cloaks do) and is shielded from most magic. Parallel to this, the Resurrection Stone was passed onto the descendants of its original owner, Cadmus Peverell, of whom Voldemort is the last descendant. Harry very likely keeps his Cloak in Hermione's bag. He uses it to stay invisible with Griphook (Warwick Davis) when they enter Gringotts Bank, attempting to get into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault.

    {
      "question": "What languages are spoken in this film?",
      "answer": "This film is spoken mostly in English with some characters speaking Parseltongue in some scenes. During the scene where Voldemort finds out Gringott's was robbed, he speaks Parseltongue to his snake Nagini, with on screen subtitles. In the scene where Ron and Hermione go to the chamber of secrets to destroy Helga Hufflepuff's cup, Ron speaks \"open\" in Parseltongue to get in. Generally only Parselmouths (Voldemort, Harry Potter, Salazar Slytherin, and Marvolo, Morfin, and Merope Gaunt) can speak Parseltongue. Ron Weasley isn't a Parseltongue but he merely muttered the Parseltongue word for \"open\" which he remembered from Harry speaking it. Ginny Weasley also isn't a Parseltongue but was able to speak it to open the chamber of secrets various times while possessed by Voldemort. Also, Professor Dumbledore can understand (and very possibly, speak) Parseltontgue, such as Goblins' and Mermish languages."

      "question": "If murder scars the soul, does this mean that Snape's soul was also ripped apart when he killed Dumbledore?",
      "answer": "No. Only an intended, malicious act of murder would cause the soul to be ripped apart. In the book, Harry sees another one of Snape's memories, where Snape voices this concern to Dumbledore. Dumbledore reassures Snape by saying that he himself wants to die on his own terms, and that is why Snape must do it as an act of mercy, which will keep Snape's soul intact. He remains reluctant and the actual killing causes him profound difficulty (Dumbledore has to effectively beg Snape to do it), showing that Snape had no intention whatsoever to kill Dumbledore, and therefore his soul will remain whole."

    },
    {
      "question": "If Snape is really a good guy, then why does he betray Harry at the beginning?",
      "answer": "Remember that Snape, at this point, is a triple agent: he is, in fact, still loyal to the Order of the Phoenix he supposedly betrayed, and therefore has to convince Voldemort and his fellow Death Eaters that he is on their side. It is quite clear that Death Eaters who outlive their usefulness (such as Lucius Malfoy) quickly fall out of Voldemort's favour. Snape has a role to fulfill until the end, so he needs to walk a delicate line, remaining an asset to the Death Eaters by providing them with valuable information, yet not enough for them to permanently defeat the Order. The books also reveal why Snape was the best person to infiltrate the Death Eaters: due to his uncanny talent for Occlumency; not even Voldemort would be able to read his mind and learn of his true loyalties.In Snape's first scene, he tells Voldemort when Harry will be leaving the Dursley's home, correcting inaccurate information provided by Yaxley. Snape is also correct in pointing out that the Auror Office is not involved in rescuing Harry, so nobody in a position of authority at the Ministry would know of the plan or its details. These were known only to the small group actually involved in the rescue, so one of them must have been Snape's source. The book's chapter on Snape's memory deals with some of this more fully. The rescue plan is actually Snape's idea, and he passes it on to Mundungus Fletcher using the Imperius Curse. In particular, it is Snape's idea to have six others pose as Harry so that Voldemort will not immediately know which is the real one. In the first half of the film, Snape notably does not give that detail to Voldemort. Voldemort is only able to correctly identify the real Harry because (in the film) Hedwig tries to come to his rescue, sacrificing her life in the process. (In the book it is because Harry refuses to kill Stan Shunpike to defend himself, instead employing the Disarming Charm (Expelliarmus), which the Death Eaters recognize as his \"signature move\".) Snape also does not give away which safe house Harry will be traveling to, something he should be able to find out quite easily."

    {
      "question": "Where does Harry end up near the end, and what is that sickly creature he finds under the bench?",
      "answer": "The ethereal representation of King's Cross Station where Harry ends up after Voldemort \"kills\" him, is known in catholic tradition as Limbo; the state between life and death for people who have not yet crossed over to the afterlife. For Harry, it represents a crossroads between life and death, hence it takes shape as King's Cross Station, Harry's personal crossroads between the Muggle and wizarding world.The reason Harry ends up there has to do with two things. Firstly, Voldemort cannot kill Harry himself due to the blood protection (the \"old magic\" mentioned by Voldemort in Goblet of Fire), which is detailed in the books but not in the movies. As Harry's mother sacrificed herself for her son, the proximity of her blood gave infant Harry a magical protection and caused the Killing Curse to backfire on Voldemort. Since Harry's blood is similar to his mother's, and Harry's blood in turn was used to resurrect Voldemort, this means that Lily Potter's blood now effectively runs through Voldemort. So this provides Harry with magical protection from death as long as Voldemort is near. Also, as neither Harry nor Voldemort know yet, Harry is the legitimate master of the Elder Wand, so whatever Voldemort tries, this wand will not kill its master, Harry.Secondly, Harry still has the fragment of Voldemort's soul inside, making him effectively a Horcrux. Voldemort's Killing curse cannot kill Harry, it merely destroys this soul fragment. Whether the weakened curse sends Harry's consciousness into Limbo, pulling Voldemort's with it, or the destruction of the soul fragments drags Harry into Limbo is debatable. Regardless, the stunted, deformed creature that Harry finds there is what remains of Lord Voldemort's soul. As the books explain, killing another person is the ultimate act of evil, one that tears the soul apart. Only a feeling of deep remorse for the killing could mend the soul, but such powerful feelings could also kill the wizard. As Voldemort committed dozens of murders and showed no remorse whatsoever, his soul is maimed and scarred beyond repair, forcing him to exist in Limbo and later the afterlife in this decrepit state."

      "question": "What happened to Peter Pettigrew?",
      "answer": "The movie gives no clear resolution on his fate; in the previous movie, he was Stunned when Harry escaped Malfoy Manor, so technically he was still alive then. However, Peter \"Wormtail\" Pettigrew () is nowhere to be seen in the Battle of Hogwarts, which is curious, given his unrelenting loyalty to Voldemort. Although this doesn't provide any conclusive evidence, it is possible that he may have been killed in Malfoy Manor during Voldemort's fit of rage. In the book, however, during Harry's escape, there is a struggle in which Harry reminds Peter that he once spared Pettigrew's life (in Prisoner of Azkaban, when Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and Remus Lupin (David Thewlis) were about to execute him) and that he owes him his life. After mentioning that, Peter loosens his grip on Harry. Immediately, Peter's artificial hand (the one he got from Voldemort in Goblet of Fire) grabs his owner's throat and strangles himself to death. Presumably, Voldemort must have made it so the hand would kill Peter if he ever disobeys him even in the slightest. Edit"

      "question": "How will Harry find the remaining Horcruxes?",
      "answer": "Unlike in the books, Harry is never told what the Horcruxes might be. Instead, the film adds the notion that he can hear them in his mind when he is near them, and he gathers ideas about where they might be throughout the story from various sources. Arriving at these locations, he listens for the characteristic Horcrux sound. This is explained as being the result of himself being a Horcrux. In particular, he gets the idea about the Cup of Helga Hufflepuff being in Gringott's when Bellatrix Lestrange () screams at Hermione after she thought they had entered her vault. For the Diadem, Harry has a vision of Voldemort talking with the Grey Lady (Ravenclaw House Ghost, Helena Ravenclaw (Kelly Macdonald), daughter of Rowena), who he later questions for its location. Concerning Nagini, Voldemort's pet snake, Harry also has a short vision where he finds out Voldemort is very concerned for the animal, leading Harry to the conclusion that Nagini is the last Horcrux. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it that Harry's horcrux can only be destroyed by Voldemort? What would happen to the horcrux if Harry were killed by someone else?",
      "answer": "As it is explained more fully in the book, Harry and Voldemort share a unique bond besides the matching twin cores of their wands. This bond was created by the fact that Voldemort used Harry's blood as part of his rebirth ritual in Goblet of Fire. Harry's blood bears the protective spell of Lily's love that was cast when she sacrificed herself for Harry, which means that Voldemort (unknown to him since he does not understand the magic of love) also bears that protective spell. If someone else were to use the Killing Curse on Harry, yes, Voldemort's accidental Horcrux (Harry) would have been destroyed, but Harry would also die as the curse is intended. But as long as Voldemort shared blood with Harry, then Harry could not be truly killed by Voldemort's Killing Curse-therefore, Voldemort destroyed his own accidental Horcrux, helping to lead to his own ultimate demise. Voldemort destroying the Horcrux was the only chance of Harry being able to \"come back to life\" and lead the final part of the battle that results in the destruction of Nagini (the final Horcrux) and Voldemort's death."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "After Neville kills Nagini with the Sword of Gryffindor, thus destroying Voldemort's last Horcrux, Harry and Voldemort begin shooting magic bolts at each other, Harry using his wand and Voldemort using the Elder Wand. Suddenly, the Elder Wand causes Voldemort's killing curse to backfire, and the wand flies out of Voldemort's hand and over to Harry. Voldemort's body begins to disintegrate and turns to dust. Later, as Harry, Ron, and Hermoine walk through the rubble that was once Hogwarts, Harry explains that the reason the Elder Wand didn't work for Voldemort was because it actually belonged to Draco Malfoy (), who was the one to disarm Dumbledore before Snape killed him. Then, when Harry disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor, Harry became the true master of the wand. When Ron enthusiastically points out that they're now invincible, Harry snaps the wand in two and tosses it into the chasm. Nineteen years past. Harry and Ginny are back on the platform, escorting their son, Albus Severus (Arthur Bowen), to platform 9¾. where Draco and his wife are sending off their son, and Ron and Hermoine are saying goodbye to their daughter before sending them off to Hogwarts, too. Albus expresses concern that he may be sorted into Slytherin House, but Harry assures him that Severus Snape, once the head of Syltherin, was the bravest man he ever knew. Harry also assures him that, should he wish to be assigned to Gryffindor House, the sorting hat will take that into account. In the final scene, the train pulls out of the station, while Harry, Ginny, Ron, and Hermoine, smiling proudly, wave goodbye to their children. Edit"

    {
      "question": "How does this film differ from the novel?",
      "answer": "The movie opens with Voldemort stealing the Elder Wand, which occurs in the book right after Harry's talk with Ollivander. Once Harry determines that there is probably a Horcux in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault, the film immediately cuts to them executing their raid. In the book they spend about a month planning out every detail. Bill Weasley also warns them not to trust Griphook, as Goblins still consider themselves master of the Griffindor sword, even though they had sold it to the wizards. In the book, both Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas were rescued from Malfoy Manor, and are apparated to safety along with Ollivander before the trio sets out. Also during this time, Remus Lupin (with whom Harry had had a major rift earlier in the book) arrives and announces the birth of his son Teddy (to whom he refers later in the book and film). He asks Harry to be Teddy's godfather, which Harry accepts.The raid on Gringotts happens largely as it does in the book, although with less danger or threat than the book gives this sequence (e.g. the duplicating artifacts in the Vault are also extremely hot). This film, like the others (except Goblet of Fire) differs in its portrayal of Polyjuice Potion, in that the user's voice (Hermione in this case) remains unchanged.Instead of also relying on the memories Dumbledore had shown him to identify Horcruxes (in the book), Harry fully discovers through his connection with Voldemort's mind what they are and where they are hidden in the movie. In the book, Harry witnesses how Voldemort is checking up on all his previous Horcruxes, since he cannot sense their destruction, and finds most of them missing (in the movie, Voldemort instantly feels it when his soul fragments are destroyed, and it temporarily weakens him).When they meet Aberforth in the book, he confronts the Death Eaters pursuing them and tricks them into thinking they were pursuing a false alarm. The mirror fragment that Harry carries around is from one mirror that he received from Sirius in Order of the Phoenix; its twin mirror is found in Aberforth's hide-out. In the movie, there is only one mirror. Aberforth goes into depth about his troublesome past with Albus: their sister Ariana was once assaulted by three Muggle boys, and from the trauma, she became unable to control her magic. Their father killed the Muggles in revenge and spent the rest of his life in Azkaban. Then their mother was accidentally killed during one of Ariana's fits of rage, forcing Albus to abandon his career and care for his sister as Aberforth attended Hogwarts. During one summer, Albus formed a friendship with Grindelwald, and together they dreamt of a world where wizards dominated over Muggles for the greater good, and they obsessed over the Deadly Hallows. One night, this led to a heated argument with Aberforth, culminating in a duel where a stray Killing Curse killed Ariana.While searching for the Ravenclaw diadem, Harry is discovered by Alecto Carrow, who, before getting stunned, immediately warns Voldemort through her Dark Mark. In the ensueing chaos, Amycus is incapacitated as well. While Harry follows Professor McGonagall under his Invisibility Cloak, she is confronted by Snape in a hallway, leading to a fierce duel, with Snape jumping out of a window, clinging to a bat-like creature (in the movie, Snape summons all students to the Great Hall, trying to coerce the students into betraying Harry. Harry himself confronts Snape, but McGonagall fights him off, after which Snape Disapparates). Harry first asks professor Flitwick about the diadem, who has no clue, then Nearly Headless Nick (who hasn't appeared in the films since the second), who sends him to Helena Ravenclaw. Helena admits to be the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw (one of Hogwart's founders). She had once stolen her mother's diadem and hid it; the Bloody Baron (Slytherin's house ghost) was send to retrieve both Helena and the diadem, but when she refused, the Baron killed her and himself in remorse, becoming ghosts.Ron and Hermione destroying the Hufflepuff Cup is shown in the movie but only recounted in the book; Hermione kisses Ron afterwards, after Ron suggests that he should help the House Elves. Malfoy enters the Room of Requirement with Crabbe and Goyle, and it is Crabbe who dies. The Fiendfire in the Room is enough to destroy the Horcrux (in the movie it requires another stab with the Basilisk fang).Professor McGonnagall's giggle about always having wanted to use \"Piertotum Locomotor\" (awakening the statues, suits of armor, etc., to defend the school) is a movie invention not in the book.Snape is killed in the Shrieking Shack-in which he has some significant personal history-rather than the boathouse, which was an environment that appears exclusively in the film.Snape's memories are far more expansive in the book, and include excerpts from Snape's life at Hogwarts and friendship with Lily; however, the friendship ends abruptly, due to Snape's grudge against James Potter and his own affiliation with the Death Eaters. There are several memories proving Snape's allegiance to Dumbledore: spying on Professor Quirrel and Durmstrang Headmaster Karkaroff, plotting with Dumbledore's portrait in the Headmaster's office, secretly helping Harry obtaining the Griffindor sword, and his reluctance to promise to kill Dumbledore (which Harry semi-witnessed in the film and Hagrid in the book of Half-Blood Prince). It also shows how Snape tried to prevent harm to George Weasley on the night that the Order of the Phoenix escorted Harry back to the Burrow, but inadvertantly cursed his ear off. However, the scene where a heart-broken Snape finds Lily and James killed by Voldemort was conceived especially for the film and is not in the book.The scope of the Battle of Hogwarts has been expanded in the movie to include viewpoints besides Harry's. Fred Weasley's death is actually shown in the book, though that of Lupin and Tonks is not. In the book, the Death Eaters are joined by many other creatures, such as spiders and Giants.Harry's conversation with Dumbledore clears up some mysteries: Harry can come back from limbo due to the protection provided by his mother's blood: when Voldemort was resurrected with Harry's blood, that protection fortunately went over to Voldemort's blood as well; as long as Voldemort is alive and nearby, Harry is protected. Also, the reason that Harry's wand was able to fight off Voldemort on its own in the previous movie, is because Harry shares blood and a piece of soul with Voldemort; when their wands connected in Goblet of Fire, Harry's wand learned to sense Voldemort's actions, and could act on its own.Dumbledore goes into detail about his friendship with Grindelwald and their youthful quest for power. Both wanted the Elder Wand to rule over the Wizarding World; he himself wanted the Resurrection Stone to reunite his dead family, whereas Grindelwald only wanted it to raise an army of Inferi. However, Dumbledore clashed with Grindelwald over the issue of Muggles (whom Grindelwald wanted to enslave), and with Aberforth over his intention to find the Invisibility Cloak to hide their sister Ariana, whom he saw as a burden. This caused a heated argument that led to a fierce three-way duel, in which Ariana was hit by a stray Killing Curse. Unsure who fired the fatal curse, a remorseful Dumbledore did not dare to confront Grindelwald for years, out of fear that he might learn that he accidentally killed his own sister. Dumbledore also explains that upon finding out that the black Marvolo ring contained the Resurrection Stone, he immediately put it on, just to see his dead sister once more and ask for her forgiveness; however, he temporarily forgot that it was a Horcrux and carried a lethal curse.Upon returning from death, Voldemort uses the Cruciatus curse on Harry's body to reassure himself that Harry is dead; the curse has no effect on him (not because Harry is dead, but because the Elder Wand will not harm its master). While carrying Harry to Hogwarts, Hagrid scolds the onlooking Centaurs for not interfering.The final confrontation is also different. In the book, upon arriving at Hogwarts, Voldemort punishes Neville for his refusal to join him by cursing him with a Full Body Bind, and putting the burning Sorting Hat on his head. At that point, hordes of wizard families climb over the walls, together with Centaurs, Thestrals, Buckbeak and Grawp, which starts another battle that moves into the castle. In the confusion, Harry escapes and hides under the Invisibility Cloak, while Neville is freed from the curse, takes the Griffindor Sword from the Sorting Hat and immediately decapitates Nagini with it (in the movie, Ron, Hermione and Neville have to chase the snake all the way through the castle during the duel).The book version of the duel does not involve Harry and Voldemort separating from the others and Apparating around the castle, with Harry revealing who the master of the Elder Wand is. Instead, Harry searches for Voldemort under his Cloak, finding that the Death Eaters' curses have little effect on his friends (later explained as a result of his sacrifice; like his mother, Harry gave his life for his friends, and his blood now protects them from harm). He finds Voldemort fighting off many other wizards, and becoming enraged when Bellatrix is killed by Mrs. Weasley. But before he can harm her, Harry reveals himself. He gets to deliver a lengthy speech, in which he both taunts and offers an olive branch to Voldemort: a chance to repent for all his actions, and a warning that the Elder Wand is now under his control (because Draco became its master when he disarmed Dumbledore, and Harry in return became master when he took Draco's wand in Malfoy Manor). More importantly, he reveals that Snape had never been Voldemort's man from the moment he targetted Lily Potter, revealing to all Snape's duplicitous heroic role. Voldemort nevertheless fires the Killing Curse, which immediately rebounds on Harry's Disarming Curse and kills Voldemort, who falls down lifelessly. In the movie, the curses meet again in mid-air, and upon defeat, Voldemort's body completely obliterates.In the book, the Malfoy family has remained in the castle and is sitting uneasily among the victims and the victorious wizards, whereas in the movie, they already left Hogwarts before the last battle. Harry uses the Elder Wand to mend his own wand, and has one last talk with Dumbledore, via his portrait in the Headmaster's office, in which Harry promises not to search for the Resurrection Stone, and to leave the wand in Dumbledore's tomb (rather than destroying it), hoping, as Dumbledore had, to destroy its power by dying without ever being disarmed while in possession of it. In the movie, Harry simply snaps the Elder Wand in two, and throws away the pieces."
