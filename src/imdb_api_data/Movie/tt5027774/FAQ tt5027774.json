      "question": "Why didn't Mildred get the license plate number of the guy that stopped into her shop?",
      "answer": "She was obviously shaken and just happy to be rid of him. She would have probably put herself together quickly but the woman who entered the shop posed another problem altogether."

      "question": "Does Dixon kill his mother near the end of the film?",
      "answer": "No he didn't kill his mother. The reason he took his gun is that he thought of killing Shane Burry. Because Dixon thinks Shane raped and killed a woman."

      "question": "Why the h... is the crop-haired guy suddenly in the gift shop? there's absolutely no legitimacy for that introduction of his character - or am I wrong? Have I missed something?",
      "answer": "The inference from what happened later in the film was that he had seen the TV news report or perhaps a newspaper and decided to see the woman responsible for the billboards, given that he had committed a similar crime overseas \"in the sandy place.\" He seems to have been traveling through or near the town at least twice that was shown. Some people who glorify crimes like rape or murder, either wishing to be or actually being a rapist or murderer themselves, do seem to find pleasure in intimidating victims, especially those who are speaking out like Mildred. You can see in the shop that he was trying to get a rise out of her and seemed to enjoy it."
