      "question": "Near the end of the film, Tom's employer shows the workers a flyer talking about \"Red agitators\" and Tom asks about the meaning of the message -- what's the message?",
      "answer": "The flyer was probably distributed by a group of local employers who want to drive out both workers (likely the refugees from Dustbowl states like Oklahoma where the Joads are from) and people like Tom's employer, who give them jobs, or at the very least to get them to stop the practice. Tom's boss says he likes Tom and his other workers and wants to keep them on but he also realizes that his business could suffer because of the other employers in the area.At this point in US history, people like the Joads were driven off their land in a huge region in the American Midwest where a severe drought had made the land barren. Though it's not specifically discussed, Tom's family were probably prosperous farmers who lost their land and livelihood when the barren conditions made it impossible to make a living farming.The timing of the event was also detrimental, coming during the Great Depression when the US economy took a bad hit after the stock market collapsed in 1929. Millions suddenly found themselves out of work, their financial security was decimated, people lost their homes and any land they owned when it was repossessed by their banks.The Joads were one of those families, so they left for California to seek work after they were given or found a flyer promising work and prosperity in California. Just after they arrived, they were employed by a group of shady orange growers who had them working under strict rules -- no bruised fruit when they picked it, no wandering the grounds of the camp after a certain hour, only getting a meager wage and a small percentage of the value of what they picked. Right as they're leaving -- after Tom's run-in at the creek near the entrance where he receives his facial wound -- you hear one of the men running the camp telling a newly arrived group that the percentage for picking fruit has gone down. It's clear that the orange growers have been running a scam on migrant workers and want them working under harsh conditions for little pay so as to keep them obedient but also to replace the workforce they previously had. The protesters the Joads see outside the gate are the workers who were striking or may have been fired for trying to unionize for better working conditions. The Joads and other families like them are scabs, people hired to take the place of official employees of the orange plantation."

      "question": "What is 'The Grapes of Wrath' about?",
      "answer": "After losing their Oklahoma farm during the Great Depression in the 1930s, the entire Joad family—Pa (), Ma (Jane Darwell), Grandpa (Charley Grapewin), Grandma (Zeffie Tilbury), Uncle John (Frank Darien), Al (O.Z. Whitehead), Noah (Frank Sully), Winfield (Darryl Hickman), Ruthie (Shirley Mills), Rose-of-Sharon 'Rosasharn' Joad Rivers (Dorris Bowdon) and her husband Connie (Eddie Quillan), along with Ex-Preacher Casy (John Carradine)—pack their meager belongings onto an old truck and head to California to find work. Virtually penniless, they take odd jobs, mostly as migrant workers, barely making enough to feed the family. Along the way, they meet other 'Okies,' endure prejudice, injustice, harassment, exploitation, desperation, death, and the possibility that there may be no work for them in California. Edit"

      "question": "Is \"The Grapes of Wrath\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "Yes. The Grapes of Wrath is a novel published in 1939 by John Steinbeck. It earned Steinbeck both a Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize for Literature. The novel was adapted for the movie by American film maker Nunnally Johnson."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an \"Okie\"?",
      "answer": "Technically, it's a slang term for a person from Oklahoma. During the Depression years, it became a derogatory term for people who were forced off their farms in Oklahoma and other \"dustbowl\" states and who became impoverished vagabonds searching for jobs as migrant workers. Many went to California where they could harvest crops as depicted in the novel and the movie."

    {
      "question": "To what does the title \"The Grapes of Wrath\" refer?",
      "answer": "The title comes from the Battle Hymn of the Republic by Julia Ward Howe: Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; he is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored... Steinbeck uses the title in the book (at the end of chapter 25), talking about the starving people watching food being destroyed because it won't turn a profit: And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listen to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is the failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage."

    {
      "question": "Why was Tom in prison for four years?",
      "answer": "Tom was sent to prison for killing a man in a fight. It was an acquaintance of his, and they were a bit drunk and at a dance. The man came at him and stabbed him with a knife, and Tom killed him with a shovel. He was sentenced to seven years but was paroled after four."

    {
      "question": "What happened to Noah?",
      "answer": "Noah, Tom's mentally challenged brother, is last seen when the family stops to bathe in the Colorado River after just crossing the border into California. They are harassed by the local law who tell them to \"press on\" - they don't want no \"Okies\" hanging around. They have to get out of the area fast or risk possible problems with the police. Noah is not seen again, and his disappearance is not explained in the movie. In the novel, Noah insists on staying there. His rationale is that at least he can catch fish in the river."

      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "The cops come through the camp taking down license numbers while everyone is asleep. Realizing that they are looking for him and that his continued presence in the camp would pose a danger to his family, Tom decides to leave. As he sneaks out of the tent, Ma wakes up and asks whether he's going to say goodbye. She offers to hide him from the cops, but Tom refuses because that would make her an abettor. Tom kisses his sleeping Pa and explains to Ma that he's going to follow in Casy's footsteps, in an attempt to find out why good people are starving and being driven off their farms while rich landowners allow good land to lie fallow. Tom promises to come back when everything blows over, kisses Ma, and walks away into the night. The next morning, the Joad family packs up and heads north to Fresno, where they've heard that there's 20 days of work to be had. As they drive, Pa bemoans the fact that it is Ma, not him, who is keeping the family together, and Ma explains to him that it's because men and women look at life differently. Men see life in jerks whereas women see life as a continuous flow, like a stream. Rich fellas come and go, she opines, but we Joads will go on and on forever \"'cause we're the people.\""

      "question": "How closely does the movie follow the book?",
      "answer": "Those who have both seen the movie and read the book seemingly agree that, like almost any movie made from a classic novel, the movie version usually loses detail and condenses the storyline in order to fit it in the allotted run time. The most notable difference, and the one that draws the most criticism, is in the movie's ending, which was altered drastically because of the very strict movie codes in existence during the 1930s and 40s. The book ends with Rosasharn giving birth to a stillborn. With no baby to suckle, she ends up nursing a dying man in order to give him the nourishment."

      "question": "Any recommendations for other movies about the Great Depression?",
      "answer": "Virtually every American movie with a contemporary setting made between 1930 and 1940 touches on the Depression in some way. Some of the more well-known of these movies include , Bonnie and Clyde (1967), Paper Moon (1973), The Sting (1973), Of Mice and Men (1992), They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (1969), Bound for Glory (1976), Chinatown (1974), Citizen Kane (1941), It's a Wonderful Life (1946), King Kong (1933), and Seabiscuit (2003), and that's just the tip of the iceberg. Edit"
