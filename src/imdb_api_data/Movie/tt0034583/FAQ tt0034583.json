      "question": "Was Ronald Reagan originally cast as Rick?",
      "answer": "No. A single press release from Warner Bros. attached and Ann Sheridan to the project, but it was likely just a filler piece, designed to keep studio contract players in the press. On that basis, it has become an oft-repeated trivia piece, but there was no basis to it. For a longer discussion, see here. Edit"

      "question": "What exactly are \"letters of transit\"?",
      "answer": "For the plot of the movie, they're specialized documents that allow the bearer to travel anywhere in the world, including from Nazi-occupied countries. The letters are actually a \"MacGuffin\" - a term director and writer Angus MacPhail coined to describe a plot point that is deliberately left vague so as not to draw too much emphasis away from the real story but still is a driving factor in propelling the story itself. The letters themselves are entirely fictional. Edit"

      "question": "Is the character Victor Laszlo's name mispronounced?",
      "answer": "Yes. In Hungarian, 'sz' is pronounced as an 's' as in 'lasso' and not with a 'z' sound. The character is from Czechoslovakia (now two independent countries). Before WWI and the Treaty of Trianon, there was no such country as Czechoslovakia, as it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In fact, the very name itself, 'Laszlo', is a quintessentially Hungarian (Magyar) name: Saint LÃ¡szlo was the third king of Hungary, from 1077 to 1095 (under a constitutional monarchy established in 1000 AD)."
