      "question": "Is this movie considered fiction, or based on a true story?",
      "answer": "The plot is mostly fiction, but its origins can be traced back to stories that Sam Mendes' grandfather, Alfred Mendes, told to him when he was a boy. Like most, if not all war films, they are generally fiction inspired by true events."

      "question": "What is the song sang by a soldier towards the end of the movie?",
      "answer": "The folk song \"Poor Wayfaring Stranger,\" also known as \"I Am a Poor Wayfaring Stranger\" sung by Jos Slovick."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who is credited with singing the trailer version of Wayfaring Stranger?",
      "answer": "In the final credits of the film, Jos Slovick is credited with singing \"Wayfaring Stranger.\" He appears in the film, with his character named \"Wayfaring Stranger Soldier.\" If you check his name on IMDb, he has six film credits as an actor to date, including small roles in \"Les Mis√©rables\" and the television adaptation of \"Howards End.\""

    {
      "question": "Was it a mistake when Mark Strong used \"Miles\" instead of \"Kilometres\" when telling the soldiers about the detour from the broken bridge, since they are British?",
      "answer": "Britain used the Imperial measurement system until1965 and, since at least 1500, has used miles to measure speed and distance.Having said that, Mark Strong would probably have relayed the distance in kilometres (spelled kilometers in French) as this is set in France and any milestones would have been measured that way."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the German soldier say when he is rescued from the plane crash?",
      "answer": "\"I don't want to die\" - It was also stated that the British Soldiers would not have attempted to save the German Pilot. That is incorrect. The pilots on both sides, though hated were also highly respected. German pilot Werner Voss would visit enemy pilots that survived after he shot them down, giving them presents, congratulating them on their skills, and even giving them autographed pictures of himself. When Manfred von Richthofen, known as the Red Baron, was killed in battle, the British recovered his body and buried him with full Military Honors. A wreath was placed on his casket with an inscription \"our gallant and worthy foe.\""

    {
      "question": "Who is the person (the vocalist) actually singing \"Wayfaring Stranger\"?",
      "answer": "Per the movie end credits, Jos Slovick."
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the point of shooting the flare in the air to be rescue if the two soldiers just kept walking? Shouldn't they stayed and wait for help to come?",
      "answer": "The flare wasn't to be rescued. The Lieutenant who gave it to them did not think the soldiers would make it safely to the German trench, and told them to send up the flare if they got there. That would show him the Germans had indeed gone."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the dialects spoken by the soldiers in the lorry?",
      "answer": "One of them is a Scouser (Liverpool) and another one a Cockney. There is also an Indian and a Scot and one from Ulster"
    },
    {
      "question": "Were there really black and Indian soldiers on the Western Front?",
      "answer": "Yes. At the time there were about 20,000 Black people living in Britain, mostly in seaports, and many joined their local regiments and served alongside white soldiers. There were also Black colonial units on the western front, such as the British West Indies Regiment.Indian Expeditionary Force \"A\" also served on the Western Front from 1914 until late 1915. Indian cavalry units served in France for a longer period, but they would have been in their own units and not in British Army units. Indian soldiers would have served in the Indian Army, a different entity from the British Army. More than a million Indians served in their army during the war, the largest volunteer force raised.Non-white soldiers mostly served in separate regiments under the command of White British officers, rather than mixed units as seen in this film, but there are photographs and records of ethnically mixed units."

      "question": "Who milked the cow for the bucket of milk?",
      "answer": "The Germans before they left."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the plane crash scene have any sort of VFX back-up?",
      "answer": "Yes, the VFX team created a digital plane crashing into a digital barn, which was then blended with a physical replica of the plane shot on location."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are there flares going off in the ruined town?",
      "answer": "To light the area for German soldiers"
    },
    {
      "question": "When checking the German trenches, would it have been normal to carry their rifles like modern day, American swat teams, i.e. looking down the sights?",
      "answer": "No, as may be seen from old combat photographs, soldiers usually carried their rifles at chest or shoulder height without actually aiming them, positions known as 'port arms' or 'high port arms'. Upon seeing something at which to shoot, the rifle would have been raised for aiming, often called 'snap firing'. Though when searching an enemy base, where the enemy would be around any corner, it's wise to have your weapon ready and aimed where you're looking in case there was something to shoot at."

    {
      "question": "Why didn't Schofield return fire when he was shot at by an advancing soldier, in the village ruins ? Had he run out of ammunition ?",
      "answer": "By this point he had a serious concussion. He was dazed and likely having difficulty focusing. Running was his best bet. Returning fire would likely end with him missing and getting shot in turn. Not to mention drawing more soldiers to his position."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did the protagonist soldiers have leather vests, unlike their comrades?",
      "answer": "Thick leather vests have been used as a form of body armor since the times of the Romans. There are photographs of soldiers in WW1 wearing thick leather vests as protection against knife attacks. While the vest is infective against the stabbing attack by a bayonet or trench knife, it would have been very effective in protecting the torso against a \"slashing\" attack by these edged weapons. The two soldiers in the film, would have been issued leather vests since they were \"penetrating enemy positions\", to scout or as in the case of the film, deliver a message, behind or near enemy lines."

    {
      "question": "Is this a remake of Joseph Conrad's book \"The Heart Of Darkness\"?",
      "answer": "No. Films tend not to be remakes of books."

      "question": "Besides the \"black-out part,\" where are the edited shots?",
      "answer": "usually when the camera would pan away from the actors off screen, or they would go into an area with lower light.Also when the actor passes behind an object, for example a large tree trunk. Behind the rock while he was floating down the river. Behind the wall when running from the German."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can the letter be dry, legible and easily unfolded after he spent so much time in the river?",
      "answer": "He carried it, along with his personal photographs, in a tin that appeared to have a very good seal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the bucket of milk a symbol?",
      "answer": "No, it is more to show the quick withdrawal of the Germans. Plus it is a partial plot point later in the film."
    },
    {
      "question": "Blake had a gold bracelet on but when his stuff was removed he only took his ring, bracelet nowhere to see?",
      "answer": "It was likely an unofficial identity bracelet - his army ID was round his neck. Schofield removed the red tag so he could hand it in, leaving the green tag and the ID bracelet so that they would know who he was when they buried him."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why couldn't they drop a note from a bi-plane to the troops with the order? Planes were flying and it would greatly improve over the speed of two troopers walking. Also wouldn't an officer send two or three messengers as insurance to save 1600?",
      "answer": "An aircraft would have probably been used in real-life. By 1917, the Royal Flying Corps had dozens of squadrons in France, some of them termed 'corps squadrons'; these would, in World War Two, be called 'army co-operation squadrons', and be used for coordination with ground units, including communication. Distance would have made little difference in this case, the destination being only nine miles away. In 1917, Canadian ace Billy Bishop attacked a German aerodrome stationed behind German lines. His airplane was a Nieuport 17, not a particularly long-distance machine. An airplane could easily have been used to drop a message."

    {
      "question": "How did Schofield live even if he gets hit by a german soldier in the house?",
      "answer": "It hit his helmet, absorbing the blow but knocking him back. The blood you see on the back of his head and neck were from hitting his head as he fell down the stairs."
    },
    {
      "question": "How come a two-hour one-shot can contain a half-a-day time span which started one afternoon and ended next morning?",
      "answer": "The movie is not actually all one shot. About two-thirds of the way through, the main character is knocked out and the screen goes black for an undetermined amount of time. There are also a few scenes where time passes quickly. I.e. when he's in the back of the truck. He sits there as the soldiers chat with each other. Within a minute or so, they exit the truck and are in a different town. More time passed than we saw."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the small metal case Schofield uses to store General Erinmore's letter and his family photos, and is it really waterproof?",
      "answer": "It's a \"Hignett's Handy Cut Virginia\" tobacco tin. The actual version has air vents on the top and bottom, so water would have seeped in. The tin is also thicker in height, so it probably would not have fit into a breast pocket. The movie version is likely just a replica. It's likely Schofield customized the tin with a rubber insert in order to use it for the very purpose of protecting items from water and mud. Given the notoriety of trench warfare being damp, wet and muddy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Later in the film, why does Schofield keep wandering out in to the open in view of German troops?",
      "answer": "It's likely the head wound he suffered lead to a concussion. Which could lead to confusion and errors in judgement."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the German pilot stab Blake after they were clearly trying to help him?",
      "answer": "While they dragged the pilot out of the flaming wreckage he is still in a lot of pain from the burns and is confused and dazed. A possible explanation is that he simply tries to survive and get and away from the British soldiers by stabbing Blake."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why doesn't Schofield see or even hear the 20 soldiers walking up to the fallen tree? How doesn't he hear the car and 4 troop trucks pull up on the other side of the blown up farm house?",
      "answer": "The film is told from Schofield's perspective. Schofield was focused on his dying friend. It's likely that more time passed than we saw. It just seemed brief because Schofield's mind was elsewhere. Similar to when he's in the back of the truck. Only minutes pass on screen, however they reach their destination.That's the likewise explanation for why Schofield didn't notice the troops approaching. His mind was fixed on his friend dying, what he was going to do, how he had to inform Blake's family, etc."
