      "question": "What does the title of the film mean?",
      "answer": "Lock, stock, and barrel is a merism used predominantly in the United Kingdom and North America, meaning 'all', 'total', 'everything'. The effective portions of a gun are the lock, the stock, and the barrel. In early, high quality custom-made guns the lock, the stock, and the barrels would each be separately made by specialist gunsmiths for each part. The seller of the gun would state he was selling the complete item - 'lock, stock and barrel'. And given that a significant plot point of the film is about getting a pair of antique double-barrelled shotguns, they would be the \"two smoking barrels\" referred to in the title."
