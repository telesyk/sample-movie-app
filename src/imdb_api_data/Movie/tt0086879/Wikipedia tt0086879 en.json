In 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\r\nPlot\r\nIn the winter of 1823, Antonio Salieri is committed to a psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt, during which his servants overhear him confess to murdering Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The young priest Father Vogler approaches Salieri for elaboration on Salieri's confession. Salieri recounts how, even in his youth in the 1760s, he desired to be a composer, much to his father's chagrin. He prays to God that if He makes Salieri a famous composer, he will, in return, promise his faithfulness. Soon after, his father dies, which Salieri takes as a sign that God has accepted his vow. By 1774, Salieri has become court composer to Emperor Joseph II in Vienna. Seven years later, at a reception in honor of Mozart's patron, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, Salieri is shocked to discover that the transcendentally talented Mozart is obscene and immature. Salieri, a devout Catholic, cannot fathom why God would endow such a great gift to Mozart instead of him and concludes that God is using Mozart's talent to mock Salieri's mediocrity. Salieri renounces God and vows to take revenge on Him by destroying Mozart.\r\nMozart's alcoholism ruins his health, marriage, and reputation at court, even as he continues to produce brilliant work. Salieri hires a young girl to pose as Mozart's maid and discovers that Mozart is working on an opera based on the play The Marriage of Figaro, which the Emperor has forbidden. When Mozart is summoned to court to explain, he manages to convince the Emperor to allow his opera to premiere, despite Salieri and the advisers' attempts at sabotage. When Mozart is informed that his father has died, he writes Don Giovanni in his grief. Salieri recognizes the dead commander in the opera as symbolic of Mozart's father and concocts a scheme; he leads Mozart to believe that his father has risen to commission a Requiem. He then plans to kill Mozart once the piece is finished and premiere it at Mozart's funeral, claiming the work as his own. Meanwhile, Mozart's friend Emanuel Schikaneder invites him to write an opera for his theatre. Mozart obliges despite his wife Constanze's insistence that he finish the Requiem, as the opera is a riskier venture financially. After arguing with Mozart, Constanze leaves with their young son, Karl.\r\nThe opera in question, The Magic Flute, is a great success, but the overworked Mozart collapses during one performance. Salieri takes him home and persuades him to continue the Requiem, offering to take the bedridden Mozart's dictation; the two lay down the opening of the Confutatis together. The next morning, Mozart thanks Salieri for his friendship, and Salieri admits that Mozart is the greatest composer he knows. Constanze returns and demands that Salieri leave immediately. In her guilt, she locks the unfinished Requiem away in a cabinet, keeping it away from both composers; as she and Salieri argue, Mozart dies from exhaustion. Mozart is taken out of the city and unceremoniously buried in a mass grave.\r\nBack in 1823, Vogler is too shocked to absolve Salieri, who surmises that the \"merciful\" God preferred to destroy His beloved Mozart rather than allow Salieri to share in the smallest part of his glory. Salieri promises, with bitter irony, to both pray for and absolve Vogler along with all the world's mediocrities as their \"patron saint\". As Salieri is wheeled down a hallway, absolving the hospital's patients of their own inadequacies as he passes by, Mozart's laughter rings in the air.\r\nCast\r\nF.

However, Forman ultimately decided not to cast him due to his association with the character of Luke Skywalker, feeling that audiences would not believe him as the composer. Tom Hulce reportedly used John McEnroe's mood swings as a source of inspiration for his portrayal of Mozart's unpredictable genius.\r\nMeg Tilly was cast as Mozart's wife Constanze, but she tore a ligament in her leg the day before shooting started. She was replaced by Elizabeth Berridge. Simon Callow, who played Mozart in the original London stage production of Amadeus, was cast as Emanuel Schikaneder, the librettist of The Magic Flute.\r\nThe film was shot on location in Prague and Kroměříž. Notably, Forman was able to shoot scenes in the Count Nostitz Theatre in Prague, where Don Giovanni and La clemenza di Tito debuted two centuries before. Several other scenes were shot at the Barrandov Studios and Invalidovna building, former \"hôtel des invalides\", built in 1731–1737.\r\nForman collaborated with American choreographer Twyla Tharp.\r\nReception\r\nCritical reception\r\nAmadeus holds a score of 89% on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 8.9/10. The site's consensus states: \"Amadeus' liberties with history may rankle some, but the creative marriage of Miloš Forman and Peter Shaffer yields a divinely diabolical myth of genius and mediocrity, buoyed by inspired casting and Mozart's rapturous music.\" Giving the film four out of four stars, Roger Ebert acknowledged that it was one of the \"riskiest gambles a filmmaker has taken in a long time,\" but added \"(here is the genius of the movie) there is nothing cheap or unworthy about the approach,\" and ultimately concluded that it was a \"magnificent film, full and tender and funny and charming\". Ebert later added the film to his Great Movies list. Peter Travers of People magazine said that \"Hulce and Abraham share a dual triumph in a film that stands as a provocative and prodigious achievement.\" Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic put it on his list of films worth seeing. In one negative review, Todd McCarthy of Variety said that despite \"great material and themes to work with, and such top talent involved,\" the \"stature and power the work possessed onstage have been noticeably diminished\" in the film adaptation. The film's many historical inaccuracies have attracted criticism from music historians.\r\nBox office\r\nThe film grossed $52 million in the United States and Canada and by November 1985, while still in theaters overseas, had grossed over $90 million worldwide to date.\r\nAccolades\r\nThe film was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, winning eight (including Best Picture). At the end of the Oscar ceremony, Laurence Olivier came on stage to present the Oscar for Best Picture. As Olivier thanked the academy for inviting him, he was already opening the envelope. Instead of announcing the nominees, he simply read, \"The winner for this is Amadeus.\" An AMPAS official quickly went onstage to confirm the winner and signaled that all was well, before Olivier then presented the award to producer Saul Zaentz. Olivier (in his 78th year) had been ill for many years, and it was because of mild dementia that he forgot to read the nominees. Zaentz then thanked Olivier, saying it was an honour to receive the award from him, before mentioning the other nominees in his acceptance speech: The Killing Fields, A Passage to India, Places in the Heart and A Soldier's Story. Maurice Jarre won the Oscar for Best Original Music Score for his scoring of A Passage to India. In his acceptance speech for the award, Jarre remarked \"I was lucky Mozart was not eligible this year\".\r\nThe film along with The English Patient, The Hurt Locker, The Artist, and Birdman are the only Best Picture winners never to enter the weekend box office top 5 after rankings began being recorded in 1982. The film peaked at No. 6 during its 8th weekend in theaters. Saul Zaentz produced both Amadeus and The English Patient.\r\nHistoricity\r\nFrom the beginning, writer Peter Shaffer and director Miloš Forman both were open about their desire to create entertaining drama only loosely based on reality, calling the work a \"fantasia on the theme of Mozart and Salieri\".\r\nThe idea of animosity between Mozart and Salieri was popularized by Alexander Pushkin in 1830 in his play Mozart and Salieri. In it, Salieri actually murders Mozart on stage. The play was made into the opera Mozart and Salieri by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov 67 years later, which in turn had its first screen adaptation by silent-film director Victor Tourjansky in 1914.\r\nAnother significant departure in the film is the portrayal of Salieri as a pious loner trapped in a vow of chastity, when in reality he was a married family man with eight children and at least one mistress.\r\nMozart was indeed commissioned to compose a Requiem Mass by an anonymous benefactor. In reality, the patron turned out to be Count Franz von Walsegg, who was grieving after the death of his wife.\r\nAlternative version\r\nAmadeus premiered in 1984 as a PG-rated movie with a running time of 161 minutes. Director Miloš Forman introduced an R-rated version with nearly 20 minutes of restored footage. This version was released by the studios as a Director's Cut on September 24, 2002. Forman justified why those scenes were cut in the first place in the 1995 supplemental material for Pioneer's deluxe LaserDisc. However, he explained why the scenes were eventually restored in a subsequent 2002 interview with The A.V. Club:\r\nWhen you finish a film, before the first paying audience sees it, you don't have any idea. You don't know if you made a success or a flop, when it comes to the box office. And in the '80s, with MTV on the scene, we are having a three-hour film about classical music, with long names and wigs and costumes. Don't forget that no major studio wanted to finance the film, for these reasons. So we said, \"Well, we don't want to be pushing the audience's patience too far\". Whatever was not directly connected to the plot, I just cut out. But it was a mutual decision. I wanted the best life for the film myself... Well, once we are re-releasing it on DVD, it doesn't matter if it is two hours and 40 minutes long, or three hours long. So why don't we do the version as it was written in the script?\r\nMusic\r\nFilm credits\r\nMusic conducted and supervised by Neville Marriner\r\nMusic coordinator: John Strauss\r\nOrchestra: Academy of St Martin in the Fields, conducted by Neville Marriner\r\nChoruses Academy Chorus of St Martin in the Fields, conducted by László Heltay Ambrosian Opera Chorus, conducted by John McCarthy The Choristers of Westminster Abbey, conducted by Simon Preston\r\nAcademy Chorus of St Martin in the Fields, conducted by László Heltay\r\nAmbrosian Opera Chorus, conducted by John McCarthy\r\nThe Choristers of Westminster Abbey, conducted by Simon Preston\r\nInstrumental soloists Piano Concerto No. 22 in E-flat major, K. 482: Ivan Moravec Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466: Imogen Cooper Adagio in C minor for Glass Harmonica, K. 617: Thomas Bloch with The Brussels Virtuosi, conducted by Marc Grauwels\r\nPiano Concerto No. 22 in E-flat major, K. 482: Ivan Moravec\r\nPiano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466: Imogen Cooper\r\nAdagio in C minor for Glass Harmonica, K. 617: Thomas Bloch with The Brussels Virtuosi, conducted by Marc Grauwels\r\nParody backgrounds: San Francisco Symphony Chorus\r\n\"Caro mio ben\" by Giuseppe Giordani: Michele Esposito, soprano\r\nOriginal soundtrack recording\r\nThe soundtrack album reached No. 1 in the Billboard Classical Albums Chart, No. 56 in the Billboard Popular Albums Chart, has sold over 6.5 million copies and received thirteen gold discs, making it one of the most popular classical music recordings of all time. It won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Album in 1984.\r\nDisc 1\r\nDisc 2\r\nAll tracks on the album were performed specifically for the film. According to the film commentary by Forman and Schaffer, Marriner agreed to score the film if Mozart's music was completely unchanged from the original scores. Marriner did add some notes to Salieri's music that are noticeable in the beginning of the film, as Salieri begins his confession.\r\nThe aria \"Ruhe sanft\" from the opera Zaide does not appear in the film.\r\nCharts\r\nMore Music from the Original Soundtrack\r\nIn 1985 an additional album with the title More Music from the Original Soundtrack of the Film Amadeus was issued containing further selections of music that were not included on the original soundtrack release.\r\nThe Masonic Funeral Music was originally intended to play over the closing credits, but was replaced in the film by the second movement of the Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor (included on the Original Soundtrack Recording).\r\nDirector's Cut soundtrack\r\nIn 2002, to coincide with the release of the Director's Cut of the film, the soundtrack was remastered with 24-bit encoding and reissued with the title Special Edition: The Director's Cut – Newly Remastered Original Soundtrack Recording on two 24-karat gold CDs. It contains most of the music from the previous two releases, but with the following differences.\r\nThe following pieces were added for this release:\r\nSalieri's March of Welcome turned into \"Non più andrai\" from The Marriage of Figaro (includes dialogue from the film)\r\nAdagio in C minor for Glass Harmonica, K. 617 (from a new 2001 recording)\r\nThe following pieces, previously released on More Music from the Original Soundtrack of the Film Amadeus, were not included:\r\nMasonic Funeral Music, K. 477\r\nSix German Dances (Nos. 1–3), K. 509",

In it, Salieri actually murders Mozart on stage. The play was made into the opera Mozart and Salieri by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov 67 years later, which in turn had its first screen adaptation by silent-film director Victor Tourjansky in 1914.</p><p>Another significant departure in the film is the portrayal of Salieri as a pious loner trapped in a vow of chastity, when in reality he was a married family man with eight children and at least one mistress.</p><p>Mozart was indeed commissioned to compose a Requiem Mass by an anonymous benefactor. In reality, the patron turned out to be Count Franz von Walsegg, who was grieving after the death of his wife.</p><br/><h3>Alternative version</h3><p>Amadeus premiered in 1984 as a PG-rated movie with a running time of 161 minutes. Director Miloš Forman introduced an R-rated version with nearly 20 minutes of restored footage. This version was released by the studios as a Director's Cut on September 24, 2002. Forman justified why those scenes were cut in the first place in the 1995 supplemental material for Pioneer's deluxe LaserDisc. However, he explained why the scenes were eventually restored in a subsequent 2002 interview with The A.V. Club:</p><blockquote>When you finish a film, before the first paying audience sees it, you don't have any idea. You don't know if you made a success or a flop, when it comes to the box office. And in the '80s, with MTV on the scene, we are having a three-hour film about classical music, with long names and wigs and costumes. Don't forget that no major studio wanted to finance the film, for these reasons. So we said, \"Well, we don't want to be pushing the audience's patience too far\". Whatever was not directly connected to the plot, I just cut out. But it was a mutual decision. I wanted the best life for the film myself... Well, once we are re-releasing it on DVD, it doesn't matter if it is two hours and 40 minutes long, or three hours long. So why don't we do the version as it was written in the script?</blockquote><br/><h3>Music</h3><h4>Film credits</h4><ul><li>Music conducted and supervised by Neville Marriner</li><li>Music coordinator: John Strauss</li><li>Orchestra: Academy of St Martin in the Fields, conducted by Neville Marriner</li><li>Choruses Academy Chorus of St Martin in the Fields, conducted by László Heltay Ambrosian Opera Chorus, conducted by John McCarthy The Choristers of Westminster Abbey, conducted by Simon Preston</li><li>Academy Chorus of St Martin in the Fields, conducted by László Heltay</li><li>Ambrosian Opera Chorus, conducted by John McCarthy</li><li>The Choristers of Westminster Abbey, conducted by Simon Preston</li><li>Instrumental soloists Piano Concerto No. 22 in E-flat major, K. 482: Ivan Moravec Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466: Imogen Cooper Adagio in C minor for Glass Harmonica, K. 617: Thomas Bloch with The Brussels Virtuosi, conducted by Marc Grauwels</li><li>Piano Concerto No. 22 in E-flat major, K. 482: Ivan Moravec</li><li>Piano Concerto No. 20 in D minor, K. 466: Imogen Cooper</li><li>Adagio in C minor for Glass Harmonica, K. 617: Thomas Bloch with The Brussels Virtuosi, conducted by Marc Grauwels</li><li>Parody backgrounds: San Francisco Symphony Chorus</li><li>\"Caro mio ben\" by Giuseppe Giordani: Michele Esposito, soprano</li></ul><h4>Original soundtrack recording</h4><p>The soundtrack album reached No. 1 in the Billboard Classical Albums Chart, No. 56 in the Billboard Popular Albums Chart, has sold over 6.5 million copies and received thirteen gold discs, making it one of the most popular classical music recordings of all time.
