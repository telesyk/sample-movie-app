      "question": "Is \"Amadeus\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "Amadeus was filmed from a screenplay by English playwright Sir Peter Shaffer, who adapted it from his 1979 stage play Amadeus. The movie won the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture of 1984. The idea that Salieri \"killed\" Mozart was first presented by Russian author Alexander Pushkin's 1830 verse drama Mozart i Salieri."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is this film titled with Mozart's supposed middle name?",
      "answer": "The middle name is not \"supposed\". Mozart was baptized as \"Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart\", \"Theophilus\" being the Greek Version of the Latin name \"Amadeus\", both of which mean \"loved by god\" or \"dear to god\". This translation, of course, corresponds to Salieri's constant complaint that God chose this infantile human being to be the greatest composer he (Salieri) had ever heard, although Mozart didn't deserve it, whereas Salieri had devoted his whole life (esp. his chastity) to God, if God made him the greatest composer that ever lived to praise God with his music."

    {
      "question": "Was Salieri a real person or just made up for the movie?",
      "answer": "This just goes to show that Salieri (played by ) was right, that he would be forgotten while the upstart Mozart (played by Tom Hulce) would be written in history. Yes, Antonio Salieri [1750-1825] was a real person, an Italian composer and conductor. As the Austrian imperial Kapellmeister from 1788 to 1824, he was one of the most important and famous musicians of his time. However, as near as it's possible to tell, he was not out to kill Mozart. Although they competed for some commissions, all indications are that they had a friendly relationship. Salieri lent Mozart court manuscripts and even tutored one of his sons. He was an important and sought after teacher, and his most famous pupils include Beethoven, Schubert, and Liszt. Edit"

    {
      "question": "Was Mozart such a goofball as he is depicted in this film?",
      "answer": "Not in Marcia Davenport's Mozart (1932), a biography, but you never know. In private, Mozart could be crude. In his letters, he could be quite insulting and had a love of scatological humor. He wrote canons with titles like \"Leck mich im Arsch\" (\"Lick My Ass\"). He also loved to drink, party, and gamble, often spending copious amounts of money. Another point is that almost all of Mozart's dialog spoken in the movie was Mozart's own words, translated from the German, of course, and taken from his letters and other sources."

    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "Mozart collapses from exhaustion during the premiere performance of The Magic Flute. Salieri takes Mozart home and puts him to bed. Mozart thanks Salieri for coming to his opera, and Salieri assures Mozart that he is \"the greatest composer known to me.\" Suddenly, there comes a pounding on the door. Mozart is certain that it's his mysterious patron and tells Salieri to answer the door and ask him for money. It's really only the cast from The Magic Flute checking on Mozart's well-being and bringing him his cut of the night's take. Salieri takes the money to Mozart and tells him that his patron has promised him another 100 ducats if he will finish the Requiem by tomorrow evening. Badly in need of the money, Mozart agrees to work on it, dictating while Salieri transcribes. Meanwhile, Constanze () has decided to return home. When she finds Salieri there, she orders him to leave and locks the Requiem away despite Salieri's insistence that he will respect only Mozart's wishes. When Constanze turns to Mozart to get him to back her up, she realizes that he is dead. Mozart's body is subsequently placed in a black coffin, loaded on a funeral wagon, and taken outside the city to be dumped into a mass grave, in accordance with Viennese custom. The scene then switches to Salieri's confession to Father Vogler (Richard Frank). Tears fill the eyes of the priest, while Salieri laughs and explains that God killed Mozart rather than allow his \"beloved\" to share his glory with a mediocrity like himself. \"I am the patron saint of mediocrity,\" Salieri says as the attendant wheels him away to breakfast on sugar rolls. As Salieri is taken down the hall, he absolves mediocrities everywhere, and Mozart laughs. Edit"

    {
      "question": "What did Mozart really die of?",
      "answer": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart died on 5 December 1791 at the age of 35. The cause of death has been debated over the years, but the most widely accepted hypothesis is that he died from rheumatic fever, an inflammatory disease that sometimes follows after a Streptococcus infection."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the differences between the theatrical cut and the Director's Cut of the movie?",
      "answer": "Milos Forman's famous biopic has been released as a Director's Cut on DVD that runs approximately 20 minutes longer and features several extended plot sequences with a more or less sexual undertone but there are also \"normal\" scenes that have been trimmed for the theatrical version."

      "question": "Why is Constanze so unpleasant towards Salieri near the end?",
      "answer": "In the Director's Cut there is a scene, omitted from the Theatrical Version, where Constanze tries to persuade Salieri to help her husband. Salieri apparently agrees at the condition that she has sex with him but, when she begins to undress, Salieri calls his servants and has her thrown out of his house. This cruel humiliation explains Constanze's bitterness towards Salieri near the end of the movie."
