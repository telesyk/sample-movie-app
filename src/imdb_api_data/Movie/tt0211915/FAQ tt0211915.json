      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "After learning that Nino has gone out with Gina (), Amélie goes home to bake a plum cake. She fantasizes that Nino buys a packet of yeast from Lucien (, slips into her apartment, and rustles the bead curtains to get her attention, but it turns out to be the cat. Suddenly, the doorbell rings, and Amélie can hear Nino calling her name outside the door, but she remains silent. Nino slides a note under the door that reads, \"Je retournerai (I'll be back).\" As she watches him walk down the street, her telephone rings. It is Raymond Dufayel (Serge Merlin), who tells her to go into her bedroom where she finds that he has set up a videotape of himself warning her not to let this chance pass her by. She races out the front door only to come face to face with Nino. Wordlessly, she pulls him inside and kisses him gently on the side of his lip, on his neck, and on his eyebrow. Nino responds by kissing her in the same places. When they finally kiss each other fully on the lips, Raymond can be seen watching them through the window with his binoculars, while Lucien videotapes the happy event. Later, presumably after making love, Nino and Amélie lie in bed together. Meanwhile, the rest of the world goes on, e.g., Hipolito (Artus de Penguern) sees one of his sayings written on a wall, Dominique Bretodeau (Maurice Bénichou) feeds the oyster to his grandson, Raymond paints Renoir's \"Luncheon of the Boating Party\" in the style of Lucien, and Amélie's father Raphael (Rufus) decides to take an international trip. In the final scene, Nino takes Amélie for a ride on his moped. Edit"

      "question": "Any recommendations for French movies similar to \"Amélie\"?",
      "answer": "Yes. Viewers who have seen Amélie have mentioned several movies either similar in mood or cinematography. Two other movies by the same director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, include (1) in which a woman searches for her fiancé and (2) the surrealistic Delicatessen (1991). In Mon meilleur ami (2006), a man hires a taxi driver to be his \"best friend\" in order to prove to his business partner that he actually has one. Paris, je t'aime (2006) is a collection of short films about Paris from some 20 different directors. In Jeux d'enfants (2003), a man and a woman, best friends, compete with each other to perform outrageous stunts and maybe fall in love. La science des rêves (2006) is a story about a man who deals with falling in love by escaping into a dreamworld. In Chocolat (2000), a woman opens a chocolate shop that shakes up the rigidly moralistic community. Edit"
