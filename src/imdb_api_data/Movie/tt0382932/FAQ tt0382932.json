      "question": "What is a ratatouille?",
      "answer": "Ratatouille is a French Provençal dish made from stewed vegetables. The dish is versatile and can be served with rice, potatoes, baguettes, or itself can be a side dish. Its main basic ingredients consist of eggplant (aubergine), tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, and zucchini (courgettes). The name of the dish derives from the French touiller, which means to stir, although the root of the first element, rata, is slang from the French Army, which means chunky stew. The title of the movie is somewhat a play on words, since the first three letters are R-A-T, spelling out the word \"rat\", which, of course, makes a reference to the main character, Remy."

      "question": "What does saffron look like?",
      "answer": "Saffron in its natural form consists of bright orange-red filaments, the thread-like stigma of the flower of the saffron crocus. Saffron turns yellow when cooked. A simple image search for saffron will show that the artists at Pixar nailed its look perfectly."

      "question": "Why and how does the spirit of Gusteau appear to Remy?",
      "answer": "Remy's age is never mentioned and the movie takes place two years after Gusteau died. Some viewers say that the final conversation between them in the car is meant to suggest that Remy is Gusteau reincarnated and that's why he has his talent for cooking. Others interpret it as Remy's extremely imaginative mind expressing itself through a representation of his cooking hero whom he watched on the TV at the farm."

      "question": "Why was Chef Skinner trying to defame Linguini?",
      "answer": "Chef Skinner was in the midst of starting new businesses that sold fast foods. He would publicize these businesses by using the face of Gusteau which would maximize profits because Gusteau was famous for being a great chef. When Linguini started to cook, the restaurant was getting more attention than ever, but it was over Linguini's face. This meant that Gusteau's face was becoming less and less famous and Chef Skinner would not be able to run a business with his face if no one knew it. Skinner attempted to defame Linguini and publicize Gusteau's face again by trying to make him cook a disgusting food."

      "question": "Any recommendations for other movies by Pixar Animation Studios?",
      "answer": "If you like Pixar's animation in Ratatouille, you'll certainly want to see some of the other Pixar productions, including and its sequels-Toy Story 2 (1999) and Toy Story 3 (2010)-and perhaps A Bug's Life (1998), Monsters, Inc. (2001), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), Cars (2006) and Cars 2 (2011), WALL·E (2008), Up (2009), Brave (2012), and Finding Dory (2016). Luxo Jr. (1986) is the short film that demonstrated Pixar's burgeoning animation talents and from which their logo is taken. An exhaustive filmography of the studio can be found here. Edit"

      "question": "What are sweetbreads?",
      "answer": "Sweetbreads are an organ meat that is actually the thymus gland of young cattle, which disappears as they become adults, and the meat of these animals is called veal. However, after patrons order them, Colette asks if veal stomach is soaking. The stomach is the organ meat known as tripe, of which there are several varieties besides veal tripe, which include beef tripe, pig tripe, and fish tripe. Because the fictional recipe cited in the film, is said (by the 'Saucier' character) to have been a failure, this incorrect use is likely intentional. This goes to explain Linguini's hesitation at the phrase as well: although unused to cooking, he would likely know what sweetbread usually is, which was common knowledge at the time of the story, and therefore be surprised and dismayed to see the wrong ingredient."
