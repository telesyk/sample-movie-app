      "question": "Is \"The Big Lebowski\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "The Big Lebowski was loosely inspired by The Big Sleep (1939), a Philip Marlowe crime novel by Raymond Chandler, which was previously adapted into (1946) and The Big Sleep (1978) (1978). However, the actual plot of the film was based on a screenplay by Joel and Ethan Coen. Edit"

      "question": "What's that song that is heard throughout the movie?",
      "answer": "\"The Man in Me\" by Bob Dylan plays at the opening credits and again when The Dude dreams about bowling after being knocked out. \"Tumbling Tumbleweeds\" by Roy Rogers & Sons of the Pioneers serves as the Stranger's theme. It plays during the introductory monologue and again when the Stranger appears next to the Dude and orders a sarsaparilla. For the rest of songs and their corresponding scenes in the movie try here."

      "question": "To whom was the line \"Life does not stop and start at your convenience...\" directed?",
      "answer": "According to rumor, the line \"Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of shit\" was directed at Joel Coen, when John Goodman thought he said \"cut.\" Source here. However, this reason is obviously a joke propagated by the Coens. The line is in the original shooting script and clearly fits the tone of the scene. Walter is expressing his sentiments about the Big Lebowski thinking he can summon the Dude during league-play. It may even be directed at Donny, since he is (again) attempting to enter the conversation without prior knowledge of what the Dude and Walter are talking about."

      "question": "Does The Dude get money?",
      "answer": "According to \"The Dude\" there was no money in the briefcase he lost. We never get confirmed if this was right or not, but from seeing The Big Lebowski (David Huddleston)'s facial expression it can be interpreted that this was the case. If there was no money in the suitcase, The Dude couldn't get his share of his money too. In addition, he never returned the suitcase so he didn't held up his part of the deal. Therefore he couldn't get his part of the deal, which was 10 % of the $ 1 million."
