      "question": "When going for a walk with the dog, why did Alex pick the dog up with the leash strangling it? He showed no aggression towards anything up to that point. That short clip just doesn't seem to fit with who Alex is?",

      "question": "Will Dover and the Birch's couple be facing a prison sentence for harassing Alex?",
      "answer": "Yes, it is discussed at the end of the movie between Grace and Detective Loki when they are in the hospital, that even if Keller is found, he will probably go to prison for capturing and abusing Alex. However, as neither Loki nor Grace apparently know about the involvement of the Birch couple, they might not be charged with anything. Even if they were to come forward with their knowledge of Alex's imprisonment, they might not receive any legal penalties as they did not really take any actions against Alex, they just did not prevent Keller from doing so."

      "question": "Why didn't the police search Alex's house?",
      "answer": "They did. Right as the forensics team was done searching the van, Loki told them to send a team over to Alex's house."

      "question": "What is this maze talked about in the movie?",
      "answer": "The maze was the necklace worn by Holly Jone's husband, the original kidnapper who is found dead in the Priest's basement. It was he who kidnapped children originally, leading to Holly taking up the mantle after his death. This is how Alex remembers the maze, the messages drawn about escaping the maze and also how Bob Taylor, who escaped and had a history of resultant trauma, came to draw mazes and hold snakes around his house. The maze represents the inescapable echoes of the original kidnapper as well as ties in to the film thematically."
