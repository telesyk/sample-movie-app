After dinner, girls Anna Dover and Joy Birch go missing after playing on a parked RV. Detective Loki responds to a police call about an RV matching the description and arrests the man inside, Alex Jones. During interrogation, Loki realizes Alex's diminished IQ prevents him from planning a kidnapping and learns that his RV contains no forensic evidence of the missing girls. Loki runs down leads on local pedophiles and finds a corpse in the house of Father Patrick Dunn. Dunn admits to killing the man after he confessed to murdering sixteen children for his \"war on God\".\r\nThe police captain releases Alex to his aunt, Holly. Convinced of Alex's guilt, Keller Dover, the father of one of the missing girls, assaults him outside the police station, where Alex whispers to him, \"They didn't cry ‘til I left them.\" After Loki finds no proof of this, Keller kidnaps Alex, and begins to torture Alex for information about his daughter, in an empty building Keller owns.\r\nAt a vigil for the girls, Loki approaches a suspicious man who flees. Loki releases a sketch of him to the community. The suspect sneaks into the Birch and Keller houses. Grace hears him and calls Loki, who learns while responding that Keller spends his nights away from home. He tails Keller to the empty building, where Keller claims he goes to drink, but Loki doesn't find Alex. Loki tracks down the suspect, Bob Taylor, at his house. The walls are covered in maze drawings and Loki opens crates filled with snakes and bloody children's clothes. Loki shows Keller and the Birch parents photos of the bloody clothes, and they identify several as Joy's and Anna's. As Taylor draws detailed mazes, Loki assaults him and demands the location of the girls. Taylor grabs an officer's gun and kills himself.\r\nKeller continues torturing Alex for the location of the girls, who cryptically talks about escaping from a maze. Keller visits Holly, learning that Alex's speech disfluency comes from a childhood accident involving the snakes her husband kept. While devoutly religious, Holly and her husband lost their faith after their son died of cancer, and adopted Alex as a way to cope. Loki matches the maze pattern in Taylor's drawings to a necklace worn by the corpse in Dunn's house. At Taylor's house, Loki is informed that most of the bloody clothes were store-bought and soaked with pig blood. Below a window outside the Dover house, Loki finds Taylor's footprints and a sock matching that of Anna's, which Keller had earlier identified.\r\nThe drugged Anna and Joy attempt escape, and Joy gets away and is found and hospitalized. When Keller grills a woozy Joy for information, she remembers little, but tells him, \"You were there.\" He immediately rushes out. Loki gives chase and arrives at Keller's building expecting to find him, but instead finds Alex. Keller goes to Holly's to find Anna, but she pulls a gun. She explains that before her husband disappeared, they abducted children as part of their war on God to avenge their son's death, and to create demons out of the traumatized parents. Alex was their first abduction, Taylor their second. Holly imprisons Keller in a hidden pit in her yard, where he finds his daughter's whistle.\r\nLoki enters Holly's house to inform her that Alex has been found, but instead finds a photo of her late husband with the maze necklace. Realizing that Holly is the kidnapper he searches and finds her giving Anna an injection. In a shootout Loki kills Holly but he is grazed in the head. He rushes Anna to the hospital while fighting unconsciousness.\r\nA recuperating Anna and Joy visit a bandaged Loki in his hospital room to thank him. Later Loki wanders the crime scene at Holly's house, where he faintly hears a whistle blowing.\r\nCast\r\nHugh Jackman as Keller Dover\r\nJake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki\r\nViola Davis as Nancy Birch\r\nMaria Bello as Grace Dover\r\nTerrence Howard as Franklin Birch\r\nMelissa Leo as Holly Jones\r\nPaul Dano as Alex Jones\r\nDennis Christopher as Mr. Jones\r\nDylan Minnette as Ralph Dover\r\nDavid Dastmalchian as Bob Taylor\r\nBrad James as Officer Carter\r\nZoë Soul as Eliza Birch\r\nErin Gerasimovich as Anna Dover\r\nKyla-Drew Simmons as Joy Birch\r\nWayne Duvall as Captain Richard O'Malley\r\nLen Cariou as Father Patrick Dunn\r\nJeff Pope as Elliot Milland\r\nGavin Octavien as Prison Guard\r\nProduction\r\nAaron Guzikowski wrote the script for the 2009 Annual Black List, and based on a short story he wrote, involving \"a father whose kid was struck by a hit-and-run driver and then puts this guy in a well in his backyard\". That short story was partially inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart\".\r\nAfter he wrote the spec, many actors and directors entered and exited the project, including actors Christian Bale and Leonardo DiCaprio and directors Antoine Fuqua and Bryan Singer.\r\nUltimately Guzikowski would credit producer Mark Wahlberg for getting the project on its feet, stating, \"He was totally pivotal in getting the film made. That endorsement helped it get around.\" Principal photography began in Georgia in February 2013.\r\nRelease\r\nMPAA Rating\r\nPrisoners premiered at the 2013 Telluride Film Festival and was released theatrically in Canada and the United States on September 20, 2013. It was originally rated NC-17 by the MPAA for substantial disturbing violent content and explicit images; after being edited, it was re-rated R for disturbing violent content including torture, and language throughout.\r\nBox Office\r\nPrisoners opened in North America on September 20, 2013, in 3,260 theaters and grossed $20,817,053 in its opening weekend, averaging $6,386 per theater and ranking #1 at the box office. After 77 days in theaters, the film ended up earning $61,002,302 domestically and $61,124,385 internationally, earning a worldwide gross of $122,126,687, above its production budget of $46 million.\r\nReception\r\nCritical response\r\nOn review aggregator web site Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 253 reviews, with a rating average of 7.30/10. The website's critical consensus states: \"Prisoners has an emotional complexity and a sense of dread that makes for absorbing (and disturbing) viewing.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100, based on 53 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".\r\nChristopher Orr of The Atlantic wrote: \"Ethical exploration or exploitation? In the end, I come down reservedly on the former side: the work done here by Jackman, Gyllenhaal, and especially Villeneuve is simply too powerful to ignore.\" Ed Gibbs of The Sun Herald wrote: \"Not since Erskineville Kings, in 1999, has Hugh Jackman appeared so emotionally exposed on screen. It is an exceptional, Oscar-worthy performance.\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Gyllenhaal was \"exceptional\" and that \"Villeneuve takes his unflashy time building character and revealing troubled psyches in the most unlikely of places.\"\r\nThe film was a second runner-up for the BlackBerry People's Choice Award at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, behind Philomena and 12 Years a Slave. Gyllenhaal received the Best Supporting Actor of the Year Award at the 2013 Hollywood Film Festival for his \"truly compelling, subtly layered\" performance as Detective Loki.\r\nNot all reviews were positive, however. Writing in The New Republic, David Thomson declared that the film was \"weary after ten minutes\" and furthermore \"hideous, cruel, degrading, depressing, relentless, prolonged, humorless, claustrophobic, and a mockery of any surviving tradition in which films are entertaining\". A mixed review came from Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com, who gave the film 2.5 stars out of a possible 4. She wrote that Jackman's performance grew \"monotonous\" and that the film sometimes verged on pretentiousness, but was redeemed by a few excellent suspense sequences and Gyllenhaal's performance, whose \"subtlety is welcome considering all the teeth gnashing going on in other performances\".\r\nAudiences\r\nAudiences polled by CinemaScore initially gave the film a grade \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale, but Warner Bros asked for a recount by the service and later said the film received a grade \"A−\".\r\nTop ten lists\r\nPrisoners was listed on various critics' top ten lists.\r\n1st – Nigel M.
