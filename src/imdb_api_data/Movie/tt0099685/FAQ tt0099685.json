      "question": "Is 'Goodfellas' based on a book?",
      "answer": "Goodfellas is based on Wiseguy, a 1986 novel by Nicholas Pileggi. The title of Pileggi's book was changed to Goodfellas because it had already been used for a TV series and for Brian De Palma's comedy Wise Guys (1986)."

      "question": "How closely does the film follow the book?",
      "answer": "The book is based on a true story, so the film follows the book fairly well except for a few changes. The character of Tommy is based mostly on mob enforcer Tommy DeSimone—in the movie, Tommy's last name is never mentioned but it's \"DeVito\" in the closing credits. Played by , Tommy is shown as a small man with a violent temper and as being somewhat older than Henry Hill (Ray Liotta)—when Tommy and Henry first meet, they're both teenagers. In reality, DiSimone stood over six feet tall and was several years younger than Henry, disappearing when he was only 29 years old. When Tommy, Henry, and Jimmy (Robert De Niro), were on their way to bury Billy Batts (Frank Vincent), Tommy was driving, not Henry. It was Tuddy (Frank DiLeo), not Tommy, who wanted Henry to come with him on the double date. Tommy just vanished, no one knows how he was killed, so the scene where Tommy is actually shot and the line about Tommy's mother not being able to have an open coffin at Tommy's funeral are both fictional and thrown in for dramatic license. The major change in the film adaptation is that Tommy isn't a main character in the book. He is only mentioned in it, but is still regarded as a violent killer. Several of the characters' names were changed for the film, the most notable being Paulie Vario, who became Paul Cicero. Tommy DeSimone was changed to Tommy DeVito, and Jimmy Conway was Jimmy Burke A.K.A. Jimmy Conway-Burke.The film also omits Henry's enlistment in the US Army in 1960 where he served for three years. While in the Army he continued to run schemes and made several connections he used after he was discharged. Edit"

      "question": "Why is there a black bar covering the airline ticket the babysitter pulls out of her purse?",
      "answer": "Warner Brothers did not receive permission to use the airline's logo in the film. It was an American Airlines ticket and the company did not want to be affiliated with the illegal operation depicted in the movie (drug trafficking)."

      "question": "Paulie tells Henry not to deal drugs after he's released from prison, but didn't seem to mind while Henry was inside... Why?",
      "answer": "Like Henry says to Karen during their argument when she visits, \"This is what happens when you 'go away,'\" i.e., when a wiseguy is sent to prison: you lose your support base in the mob, so Paul refused to help Henry's family out. The reason is never fully explained, but it's probably because Paul and other mob enforcers don't want to draw attention to the relationship they have with a convicted criminal like Henry or Jimmy. In light of that, the only way Henry could find (aside from working in the prison metal shop, etc.) to support Karen and his girls was to deal drugs in prison. Don't forget, Henry and his friends always considered themselves above manual labor or 9 to 5-type jobs, so Henry would look for an easy way to \"put food on the table\". Also, dealing drugs would earn Henry far more money than working in the prison would. Paulie tells Henry, in the backyard during the family dinner after Henry's released from prison, \"I don't want any more of that shit...just stay away from the garbage...I'm not talking about what you did inside. You did what you had to do.\" And, as we see, Henry doesn't listen to Paul's orders."

    {
      "question": "Why does Henry step out of the witness box in court and begin speaking to us as viewers?",
      "answer": "It's an old film and tv technique called \"breaking the fourth wall.\" Traditionally, a film or TV set is a closed world where the \"fourth wall\", i.e., the TV screen or film screen, is never addressed by the actors or characters in a show. By having Henry tell us directly that he was sad to be leaving the easy-going criminal life of a mobster, Scorsese makes the scene much more dramatic."

      "question": "Are the title cards right before the credits (explaining Henry, Paul, and Jimmy's fates) accurate?",
      "answer": "Yes they are, except for two updates: (1) Jimmy (whose original surname was Burke) died while being treated for lung cancer at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, NY, on April 13th, 1996; Burke had been transferred there for treatment from Wende Correctional Facility east of Buffalo, and (2) Henry Hill died in Los Angeles on June 12th, 2012, aged 69."

      "question": "How does this film compare to the other films based on the same story?",
      "answer": "Both The Big Heist and The $10 Million-Dollar Getaway cover much the same ground and feature the same characters but are more down-to-earth and tend to concentrate on the Lufthansa robbery and its aftermath. In some ways, they are more true to life; for instance, The Big Heist depicts Tommy's physical appearance much more accurately than Goodfellas does. Fundamentally it depends on how much Henry Hill's recollections are to be trusted."

    {
      "question": "Who had Tommy whacked? Was it Paulie?",
      "answer": "It was likely the crew that Billy Batts ran with. As the last time Billy was seen was at the party with Jimmy, Henry and Tommy. When earlier Tommy became enraged and tried to pick a fight with Billy. Seeing as how Billy was a made man (you cannot kill a made man without express permission from a boss) and Tommy was not; Billy's crew felt they had enough reason to kill Tommy as retribution for Billy's disappearance. It's possible Paulie gave his permission either to keep the peace with Billy Bats' crew or knowing about Tommy's involvement in Henry's drug ring."

    {
      "question": "Why did Jimmy tell Henry \"Forget about tonight\" as in \"I'm not gonna kill Murray.\" But then as soon as they left, Jimmy and Tommy kill Murray anyway?",
      "answer": "There's a few possible reasons:1) Murray had been pestering Jimmy for his cut of the Lufthansa heist money for ages. Jimmy decided to kill Murray due to being annoyed at him. But they were all having such a good time and so many laughs at the poker game, Jimmy genuinely changed his mind about killing him. However, as soon as the night was over, Murray immediately started pestering Jimmy again so Jimmy gave the signal to Tommy to whack Murray.2) Jimmy always planned on killing Murray and all the other loose ends in the Lufthansa heist instead of paying them. Murray was simply going to be first, due to how annoying he was. Jimmy asked Henry to help him, but noticed how reluctant Henry was. So Jimmy told Henry to forget about it to unburden him.3) It was actually Henry who killed Murray. We are told this story by Henry, as if he's on the witness stand. He says Jimmy asked him to help him kill Murray, but Henry didn't want to. Henry then tells us that Jimmy changed his mind and it was a huge weight off Henry's shoulders. Yet we see Murray was killed anyway. Given that Henry is a criminal and a liar, it's entirely possible he was involved in Murray's death but it's not wise to openly admit you killed someone."

      "question": "What was the point of the scene between Karen and Jimmy on the street?",
      "answer": "Karen initially went to see Jimmy to tell him that Henry had recently cleaned up his act, mostly having to do with getting him off the cocaine. She also seems to be handing him some documents, probably copies of documents that Henry had gotten from his lawyer. Jimmy also wanted to know what Henry had been talking about regarding the criminal charges of drug possession and manufacture, i.e., Jimmy wanted to see if Henry had told the police or his lawyer anything that might incriminate Jimmy himself or any of their fellow gang members. The reason he had Karen walk by the shopfront with the two shady-looking guys in it was specifically to scare and rattle her. It was likely meant as a reminder to Karen (and ultimately to Henry) that the Mafia can \"get to anyone\" or threaten them. Jimmy's plan clearly works since we see that Karen is quite upset when she gets home."
