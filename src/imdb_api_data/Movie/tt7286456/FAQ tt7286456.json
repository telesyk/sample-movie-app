      "question": "What did David Fincher think of the film?",
      "answer": "Comments Fincher made shows that he did not like the film, criticizing it as another Hollywood franchise film that steals from more original films, namely Taxi Driver and the King of Comedy. He felt that the film was a safe corporate product made to print money instead of being challenging."

    {
      "question": "Is this an origin story for the Heath Ledger Joker or is this the same Joker from the comics?",
      "answer": "This Joker is a completely standalone non-canon take on the character. It doesn't tie into any other comic book or movie continuity, but is still based on the DC character. The movie does not directly tie into Ledger's portrayal in \"The Dark Knight\" as it takes place in the 80s. The Joker famously said in \"The Killing Joke\" that his origin story is \"multiple choice,\" and this movie certainly upholds that claim with a vengeance for Arthur Fleck (mostly by making him an unreliable narrator and leaving the audience to guess how much of what it's seeing is real and how much is just hallucinatory or a self-serving memory). Like much else in this movie, whether this is *THE* Joker's origin story or just *A* Joker's origin story is left to the audience to guess."

      "question": "Did Joaquin Phoenix really go mad, losing 52 lbs. (24 kg) of weight?",
      "answer": "In preparation for his role, he only lost 15 pounds (as revealed on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon) by eating an apple per day according to director Todd Phillips. Phoenix revealed that is the standard way he loses weight for a role.It is not uncommon for dedicated actors to go through seemingly extreme weight loss for a part (former Batman Christian Bale in 'The Machinist' for example) .Because of the costs involved with making these films ,insurance requirements & partly due to Heath ledgers death after previously playing the Joker, the Physical & mental wellbeing while under contract is monitored very closely by the production companies involved. Where Joaquin took it as far as he could with Joker, Heath took it way too far, although that wasn't Heath' fault (he's a method actor afterall) so getting into the Joker was a mentally demeaning task than previously thought possible for both actors involved, Joaquin got a more monitored but mostly freed-freely abled performance as Heath went all out during production AND filming to preserve the persona hIs."

    {
      "question": "If Penny abused Arthur and was confined to Arkham, why was Arthur living with her for most of the film, wouldn't he have been separated from her by the state?",
      "answer": "In the movie Arthur is an adult. He would have been separated from her as a child but, once he turned 18, if he wanted to live with his mother as soon as she was released nobody could stop that. He also likely repressed a lot, even buying the Thomas is actually his father theory that still means we have no idea where Arthur was when she stayed at the asylum, how he contacted her and ended up living with her. If the document is a fake or not does not change that he would have been taken by child services for a while yet in his daydream he says he always lived with his mom as the only man of the family. It's not impossible he just never met her again until he was an adult after she was committed rightfully or not and tried to live back a fantasy. PS: Because if things didn't fall into place, the director would have no way to make arthur fleck the joker, and justify the name of the movie"

    {
      "question": "When Arthur's boss fired him over the gun, how come Arthur didn't mention Randall giving the gun to him because he was told to have it for self-defense?",
      "answer": "Passive people dont always stand up for their rights. He also brought a gun in a children hospital and lied by saying it was a prop when asked why he has a gun on him. Even if he throws Randall under the bus how is the boss supposed to believe him when he tries to dodge the fault altogether on instinct because he knew he'll lose the job if he tells the truth. Plus he did bring the gun in the children hospital (the same way he started dancing with it and shot the wall in his apartment) not something he did for no purpose he did want to carry the gun for self-defense even though it's a firing offense if he is caught with it. Arthur can't blame all his decision on other people being jerks or his illnesses some are his own poor judgement, like not reporting the beatdown to the store owner or calling the cops about it. Also worth noting despite initially claiming to like Arthur, his boss clearly doesn't with the sign incident having him be prebiased against anything what Arthur says because he is inherently untrustworthy as a mental patient, not even Arthur's heavy bruises seemed to convince him. Also it's possible Arthur may have decided to not bother explaining why he had the gun because he felt (possibly correctly) that nobody would listen to him anyway."

      "question": "What year is the movie set in?",
      "answer": "1981- 82 .The Cinema seen near the end the end of the film is showing 'Blow Out' .This film was first released in New York in July 1981. And the cinema appears to be an 'upmarket venue' showing 'First or 2nd' runs of films ... Also Arthur & his mother have Video Players & telephone answer machines - not common to 'lower working class families' in the 70s. Few characters are wearing flared Jeans,Bright suits or have long hair ,these were very much Out Of Style by the '80s This films many similarities to 'The King Of Comedy' ,filmed in 1981 & released in 1982 may also be a pointer to the time it is set. PS: Random nothing specific to point to, but the director tried to make us believe sometimes in the 80's when charlie chaplin's movies were still played in the halls.Another hint is the theater at the end that Thomas Wayne exits with his family during the final rioting, it has a movie poster for the film \"Excalibur\" which was released in 1981."

      "question": "Arthur and his mother live in poverty, so how could they afford to own both an answering machine and a videocassette recorder?",
      "answer": "Penny used to work for the Wayne family and may have been able to afford it at the time. She may also have been gifted it as a way to work from home or a parting giftEdit: She worked for the Waynes 30 years before the events of this movie (although in the flashback, she doesn't look like she's living in the early fifties). I'm pretty sure they hadn't invented VHS-recorders back then."

    {
      "question": "Why are they (the three men from the subway) called the Wall Street Three when Gotham is an entirely separate city from New York?",
      "answer": "Gotham could possibly have its own Wall Street. Additionally Wall Street is a metaphor or metonym for rich people. Also even though 'Gotham' is a 'Make Believe' city it is clearly modelled on New York - as seen in previous films & the 'City out of control' matches the New York of the early '80s when the film appears to be set - in 1981 there was the highest number of murders recorded & the reported crime figures eventually led to various measures including the eventual 'urban renewal programs'. PS: Good question. as I try to mention in every answer. Just tried to build up something that we could relate to in these days and also have something related to the comic book series.Edit: Gotham is based on Chicago and Metropolis (where Superman/Clark Kent lives) is based on New York as per the DC wiki."

      "question": "What kind of mental illnesses does Arthur have?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Does Arthur have an eating disorder?",
      "answer": "Although it's never mentioned in the film, it's heavily implied that Arthur may have anorexia nervosa, which is a disorder that affects women and men. He is obviously very thin, his skeletal appearance is similar to that of a person suffering from anorexia. We never see him eat, but we do see him feed his mother, and eat nothing himself. when he climbs into the fridge, there is very little food inside. Nicotine is also an appetite suppressant, so there could be another reason why he smokes so much adding to his frail physique. Anorexia is sometimes considered a form of body dismorphia, which could also be why he seems more comfortable when wearing his clown makeup.."
    },
    {
      "question": "Has Penny always been delusional or did she get her mental illness because of all the sadness in her life?",
      "answer": "There's one possibility that she's always been a genuinely disturbed woman, there's another that she was basically set up by Thomas Wayne to conceal his affair, or possibly even a mixture of the two. Ultimately, given the sheer volume of Unreliable Narrator going on in this movie, there's no possible way of knowing for sure. That said, it's likely that Penny's issues have a deeper root cause than mere sadness."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can someone explain what the red footprints were at the end along the corridor and then the running about at the end of the corridor?",
      "answer": "It's implied that Arthur killed the psychologist who was talking to him and asked him about what he was laughing about at the end of the movie.I did think that was probably the case but I also thought it was odd she was alone with him in the room considering what he had supposedly done.Note that he had handcuffs on as he spoke with her, and continued to have them when he was walking down the hall, dancing, and being chased by staff."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of condition did Arthur have that made him laugh uncontrollably?",
      "answer": "It's called Pseudobulbar affect (PBA), or emotional incontinence, which is a type of emotional disturbance characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays. PBA occurs secondary to a neurologic disorder or brain injury. Patients may find themselves crying uncontrollably at something that is only moderately sad, being unable to stop themselves for several minutes. Episodes may also be mood-incongruent: a patient may laugh uncontrollably when angry or frustrated, for example. Sometimes, the episodes may switch between emotional states, resulting in the patient crying uncontrollably before dissolving into fits of laughter."

      "question": "Arthur seems like a chain smoker. Are those cigarettes real?",
      "answer": "Yes, he smokes the American Spirit brand."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Arthur shut himself in the refrigerator?",
      "answer": "Four possibilities:1) It's to show how escape has become hard for Arthur. He wants to shut himself away from the world completely, and the fridge provides a quick and easy way to do just that, but only temporarily.2.) Metaphorically Gotham is presented to us as a cold place, in which whatever the character does he's punished for. The fridge can be understood as a representation of Gotham itself; it's cold, cramped, uncomfortable and suffocating. The character feels like he can no longer breathe, which is reinforced his consistent laughing which often appears to choke him.3.) It's a form of rebirth. The fridge can be seen as a womb of sorts, with Arthur climbing inside taking the fetal position and emerging anew as Joker. This also reinforces the idea that he's a product of his environment - cold and dark.4.) It's a suicidal fantasy, which would explain why it quickly cuts to him lying on the bed. In the first act of the film, we see Arthur's fantasy of meeting Murray play out on the screen, and perhaps this is just another case of that. Others have been quick to point out that he'd have been unable to get out once he climbed inside, so it's certainly plausible. Nevertheless, it works brilliantly as a metaphor for being born again."

      "question": "In Penny's medical file it says she had a lobotomy. Did she have this procedure before the abuse took place and could this explain how the abuse could happen without her stopping it?",

    {
      "question": "Why does Robert De Niro's character not scream for security or run off set when he realizes he is sat next to a psychopathic killer. any normal person would.",
      "answer": "The film's script clarifies that while his producer tries to end the interview, Murray refuses because he believes that it's making great television and that he may win an Emmy or a Peabody for it. Viewers have offered several possibilities:1.) He could've been stalling you can see his producer motioning to him indicating that they called the police.2.) It's possible that Murray wanted to continue making fun of Arthur Fleck to amuse the audience's thoughts on TV. Arthur even makes it very clear on the show that Murray was replaying his video to make fun of him and that's why he calls Murray \"awful.\"3.) He probably knew that he was gonna die either way. May as well try and see how the maniac's mind works.4.) He didn't know that Arthur brought a gun with him, and there were several other people in the studio. With that knowledge, Murray would most likely think he wouldn't do anything to him, and even if he did, he probably assumed that everyone in the studio would gang up on Arthur.5.) He appeared to be trying to show Arthur the error of his ways during the conversation6.) Murray may have realized that either he was going to get lots of ratings or make television history. Too tempting to let go.7.) He simply doesn't believe Arthur."

    },
    {
      "question": "When Arthur murders his mother in the hospital, the heart monitor that she is connected to does not alarm as her heart rate skyrockets, then starts to fail. This would cause the nurses to come running into the room. Setting an alarm on the heart monitor is standard medical protocol in a hospital, especially in an ICU which is where she would have been with her serious condition.",
      "answer": "It's repeatedly shown in the movie that Arthur lives in a city of corruption. Accepting that, it's easy to accept that any nurses who'd be required to step-in were just busy or neglectful/incompetent. While to assume that everyone in it is either corrupt or lazy and shiftless is perhaps getting into Arthur's nihilistic viewpoint a bit too closely. Another possibility exists; the movie makes a point of establishing that the city's budget is practically nonexistent and funding for city services has been slashed to the bone. This would presumably also include the hospitals. Simply put, there probably aren't enough nurses on staff at the time to cover all the stations and respond to all the alerts, affording Arthur an opportunity he might otherwise not have in a better healthcare system."

    {
      "question": "What kind of revolver did Arthur use?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why doesn't Arthur's doctor recommend a new doctor after their sessions end so he can keep getting his meds?",
      "answer": "Arthur's therapy and medication are paid for by the city government. The entire program was cut and Arthur can't afford it on his own."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Arthur dance down the stairs?",
      "answer": "You can see that Murray himself does little goofy dances all the time during his show and Arthur sorta seems to have taken that trait from him. It's also supposed to be a highly emotional moment for him, the first time he takes control of his own life. He basically celebrates that."
    },
    {
      "question": "When Arthur speaks about comedy being subjective is this a knock on modern comedians and their controversial jokes and skits?",
      "answer": "\"comedy is subjective\", It is sort of a truism but it does fit, some people like a certain kind of humor that can fall completely flat for others. except for the fact that obviously he's using it to justify his own actions to the point of considering 'funny' to commit murder in the context of the perspective change when he starts considering his tragic life a whole big joke with no punchline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did Murray intentionally mean to make fun of Arthur or no?",
      "answer": "Many fans doubt the reason behind Murray's inviting Arthur was to help him or get famous. He clearly was mocking him. For example when he implied that Arthur laughed in his stand up comedy performance because he thought laughing so much would force the viewers to laugh too (suggesting that he was bad at jokes so he chose this as an alternate way to entertain people instead)Also, Murray's face expressions clearly explained that he was taunting Arthur through every word that he spoke, and that he was not being amused by any of his jokes. He had just called him to increase the ratings of his show by interviewing a person who had gone viral because of his weird behavior. (Laughing previously during his performance instead of doing comedy)The real life late night talk show host David Letterman was known for inviting quirky people onto his show and subtly mocking them, especially if they had low social awarenessHowever many fans prefer to believe that the invitation was real and that Murray's motives were not merely to make fun of Arthur. Showing the clip of the lousy performance and then having Arthur give another lousy performance live would have been bad television, and Murray is, if nothing else, a good television host. Fans imagine that he was hoping that Arthur could defy the studio audience's expectations, have a successful (or even semi-sucessful) routine, and have people cheering for his bravery at taking the stage. A little bit like the William Hung experience on \"American Idol\". Hung was a bad singer, but his bravery at taking the stage and his good spirit about the audience's reaction soon won them over. Murray was, hoping for something similar."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is the film just called \"Joker\" and not \"The Joker\"?",
      "answer": "Todd Phillips suggests that this isn't necessarily supposed to be the actual Batman-fighting Joker. It's possibly him, but it could be someone who inspired him, or someone who wants to be him, or any number of possibilities. Leaving out \"the\" introduces a necessary ambiguity; after all, a key part of most versions of the Joker is that no one, not even he, truly know knows who he is or where he comes from. Or the studio is just waiting to use \"THE\" in the sequel."
    },
    {
      "question": "How was Murray able to air the footage of Arthur's comedy act without getting a release first?",
      "answer": "The comedy club probably had a disclaimer that they owned the rights to all footage taken inside the club, and authorized the use of the video."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is Joaquin Phoenix's version of Joker wearing a red suit doesn't Joker always wear purple?",
      "answer": "The suit is an homage to The King of Comedy, which the director cited as major inspiration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was Thomas Wayne corrupt?",
      "answer": "Maybe. Arthur and a number of Gotham's lower-class residents certainly seem to think so. Since this movie takes place through Arthur's eyes, and he is shown to be a far from reliable and unbiased observer, however, one might do well to take these opinions with a grain of salt."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Thomas Wayne seem to not care about anyone but himself and his family?",
      "answer": "The film is geared to provide a more sympathetic look into who the Joker is and less towards who Thomas Wayne is, the opposite that is normally done regarding Batman's history."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did Randall actually plan to set up Arthur to get him fired?",
      "answer": "Randall gave the gun to Arthur for money (which he intended to demand from him later). Even then Randall takes advantage of the good nature of Arthur by talking him into taking the gun.When things go awry, Randall quickly (and successfully) tries to push the blame on Arthur, which is when Arthur realizes the true colors of Randall.Then later, when the walls are closing in on the gun, Randall makes contact with Arthur again, to ensure that \"their stories will align\". This shows us that it is not an imagination of Arthur or a misinterpretation but rather that Randall is fully aware of his role in handing the gun over to Arthur.Most of these contacts are also contrasted by Gary. Who is never mean to Arthur and is treated rather mean by by everybody (even (maybe unintentionally) Arthur). Only in the last scene Arthur will spare him because he never was mean towards Arthur.Based on that logic, the last encounter of the trio gave Gary and Randall what they deserveSo Randall lied that Arthur got it from someone else and that Arthur even tried to buy one from Randall. The point of this is to show the self-serving nature of the world around Arthur, and how willing people are to throw others under the bus.The point is that Randall wasn't as good of a friend as we thought he was. The point is that he threw Arthur under the bus even when he didn't need to."

      "answer": "When Arthur gets his mother's records from the hospital, where it can be seen that she was involuntarily admitted at the age of 25 on November 2, 1952. Also in those records are some newspaper clippings that reveal Arthur was three years old when the authorities learned that his mother's boyfriend abused them. This puts Arthur's birth year in 1948 or 1949, meaning that he was 32-33 years old during the events of the film."

      "question": "Will Joaquin Phoenix's Joker appear in any of Robert Pattinson's Batman movies?",
      "answer": "It's unlikely. Joker is a serious drama that has very little to do with silly comic book antics of most comic films. The Pattinson Batman is more akin to the typical comic book formula."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did Thomas Wayne actually refer to citizens of Gotham as \"clowns\" if so why?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Thomas Wayne punch Arthur instead of confronting him calmly like Alfred did?",
      "answer": "Script-wise it was an easy way to make Thomas Wayne unlikable. In-story, this possibly being one of Arthur's hallucinations or self-serving memories, it specifically serves to justify Arthur's increasing animosity toward him. If this incident (or something like it) did in fact happen, Thomas was most likely \"flying off the handle\" at Arthur for having put his fingers in his son Bruce's mouth; a rather creepy violation of the child's personal space that would seriously upset any decent parent or guardian, though not necessarily to the point of provoking such a violent reaction."

    },
    {
      "question": "Was Thomas Wayne meant to be a character who is \"rude\" like Arthur Fleck says?",
      "answer": "He certainly was in Arthur Fleck's eyes. Fleck being a rather unreliable observer, one can see how Wayne would have a rather different opinion of himself. More broadly speaking, Wayne's publicly stating on television that Gotham's underclass were \"clowns\" like that guy who murdered those three brokers from his company (referring to Fleck, though Wayne didn't know he was that guy at the time) certainly made him seem \"rude\" in their eyes as well."

      "answer": "If Arthur didn't drink alcohol, they probably wouldn't have brought him wine as a present. It's more likely that Arthur became overpowered with rage, when Randall began to discuss the police investigations, and forgot about the wine."

It was a different time, with much different attitudes about smoking.As long as Arthur was able to pay for his cigarettes, he would have been allowed to have them. Forcing a mental patient to quit cold-turkey was probably viewed as unnecessarily stressful, particularly at a time when only the most strident anti-smoking crusader would have even cared. Also, cigarettes were cheap, and probably viewed by the staff as a type of pacifier.It would have been fairly easy for Arthur to get smokes. He could have gotten them through a visitor of another patient, or perhaps even through a cigarette vending machine at the hospital."

      "question": "Why did Arthur kill Murray?",
      "answer": "Because Arthur realized the reason why he was asked to go on the show was to embarrass him. He was going to be the \"joke\" to everyone. He knew that they were going to laugh at him, rather than with him. So he made a \"comedy\" bit out of it instead. Murray became the \"joke\" and that joke was death. That's exactly what Arthur alludes to right before he shoots him. He says: \"Want to hear a joke?\". He became the Joker. No one else thought that it was funny but him. Just like no one thought his comedy bits were funny but him."

    {
      "question": "Did Arthur kill Sophie?",
      "answer": "One of the mind-bending twists is that whole sections of the movie are manifestations of Arthur delusions - such as his entire relationship with his next-door neighbor Sophie. Beginning when Sophie knocks on Arthur's door and is flattered when he confessed he was following her to her place of employment. After his stand-up act, Arthur and Sophie's little romance was the only heartwarming part of Joker - but none of it was real. What was real was that after Arthur murdered his mother, he broke into Sophie's apartment, frightening her. She reminded Arthur that her young daughter was sleeping in their bedroom and the film reveals that Sophie and Arthur, in fact, barely know each other. Arthur is next seen exiting Sophie's apartment but it's never made clear whether he murdered Sophie or not. A contextual clue that maybe he didn't is later, Fleck didn't murder Gary (Leigh Gill) because the little person was the only clown at his workplace who was nice to him. Did Sophie, who was at best cordial and smiled at Arthur in the elevator, also escape death for being \"nice\" to him? The movie doesn't say. But maybe, if she lived, Sophie called the police about Arthur, which could be another reason why Detectives Garrity (Bill Camp) and Burke (Shea Whigham) returned to Arthur's apartment building to talk to him again. It's left ambiguous in the end. Up until that point Arthur has only been killing people he perceived as responsible for his situation (his mother, Randall, subway attackers). He wasn't even going to kill Murray until he kept provoking him. Even though she's frightened she still acts quite nice to Arthur (offering to get his mother) and even though she could call the police, Arthur doesn't seem to be thinking that far ahead stll (he let Gary go despite every chance he'd call the cops). However cinematographer Lawrence Sher had a more definite answer. \"We wanted to make the interpretation of the real versus what's not real, a part of the viewer's experience,\" Sher recently told /Film. \"For instance, his relationship to Sophie is a fantasy to him. Some people have asked me, 'Was she killed?' Todd makes it clear she wasn't killed. Arthur is killing people who've wronged him in a certain way, and Sophie never wronged him.\" Sher continued, \"In terms of what we did visually to play with the real and not real, there are callbacks and scenes that mirror each other. We leave hints using imagery or way we covered scenes similarly between scene. Outside of that, I like that people can have the conversation and come to their own conclusions.\" The Sophie twist puts into question just how much of the events depicted on screen are taking place inside of Arthur's head and how much are real. Phillips and co-writer Scott Silver's ending doubles down on this dilemma in the final scene, which depicts Arthur in Arkham Asylum telling a counselor she wouldn't understand why he's laughing. The scene has led to debates over whether or not the entire film is Arthur's fantasy. As for Beetz's character, Sher says it was the film's intention not to have the character die by Arthur's hands. Some fans might disagree with Sher, however, since Sophie's reaction to Arthur being in his apartment could be viewed as wronging Arthur."

      "question": "Did Thomas Wayne really have an affair with Penny?",
      "answer": "It is left unclear in the movie and is left to the viewer to interpret the idea. Penny's story is that after their affair he had her sign papers so that it would keep quiet and appear as nothing more than adoption, where Thomas says she was crazy and adopted him. However there are many clues to allude that Thomas is his father, including the photo of a young penny signed \"T.W.\" , as well as the fact that Bruce's actor played a young Joaquin in another film. Overall, Thomas' character is portrayed as a corrupt scumbag, so it is plausible he forged papers to save face. Thomas' actor even stated in interviews he played the character as if he was Arthur's father."

      "answer": "Two possibilities: 1) It's later, as the building appears to be Arkham. He's committed there instead of going to jail because of his insanity (in the comics, whenever the Joker is confined, it is at Arkham Asylum, never a regular penitentiary). It appears he is laughing about the death of Thomas Wayne, we see a flash of that scene again for a reason. 2) It's meant to be deliberately ambiguous, him being locked up for his crimes. But fans have commented that they think he was always locked up and the entire film takes place in his head."

    {
      "question": "Why didn't Murray have Arthur frisked for weapons near the end?",
      "answer": "The movie appears to be set in 1980's Gotham City, which is heavily inspired by New York in that time period. This is before the era of ubiquitous metal detectors, photo i.d.'s required for entrance to all business offices, etc. At the time, it would not have been unusual to allow Arthur to enter without frisking. Also, Arthur doesn't seem inherently unstable at first - when they meet he's just an enthusiastic fan, and based on the footage he played Arthur is just incredibly awkward and sad; it's arguably not clear until it's too late that Arthur is actually a danger. Also - and this may seem like a cop-out, but - unreliable narrator is at play here. The entire ending, after all, plays like a deranged and alienated man's ultimate fantasy - he publicly gets even with everyone who ever humiliated him, murders a famous celebrity live on national television, and not only does everyone love him, he inspires a mass movement that seems to worship him. A key point of the movie is that it gradually becomes clear that we cannot entirely trust anything we've seen. After all, Arthur's delusions invent an entire romantic subplot that turns out to have only been in his head. While some version of these events may have happened, there's no concrete evidence that they played out in any way like we see in the film, they could just be what Arthur believes / wishes happened. For all we know, Arthur never shot Murray Franklin at all, and is locked up at the end for one of the many other things we see him do, or something else entirely. Also notice that the show's director made a \"cut\" gesture in the background, meaning camera feed was probably cut off and somebody may have at least tried to slip out and find a phone to call the police. (Early eighties, no cell phones.) Meanwhile, Murray was doing what he was best at. He talked to the madman, let him have his rant, give him attention, be entertaining and engaging. In doing this, he kept Joker's attention on him and off the audience and other two guests. Maybe what he does could be seen as less idiotic and more heroic in that light. \"Not all people are awful.\" Also, Murray seems to understand that Arthur isn't actually insane, It's clear that Arthur is trying to justify his crimes, and as far as Murray can tell, Arthur is pretending to be the subway murderer to gain attention. He asks several times to get Arthur to confirm that he's the killer. He would expect his crew to be running for help at this point as his stage manager was questioning whether or not Arthur was a good guest to have. Also Murray had no way of knowing Arthur had his gun on him. Perhaps he even expected his crew to check for weapons, but they slipped up. It could be that it's someone else's fault Murray got killed because his team didn't up security on the show like they really should have."

      "question": "Was the whole movie a reality, or was all just in Arthur's head and he was incarcerated the whole time?",
      "answer": "There is every indication that the whole thing was in Arthur's head. If it was reality there is no way ( after killing all those people ) they would have allowed Arthur to be in the interview room at Arkham just sitting opposite his counsellor. The whole thing was brilliant, and huge, and like he said to her, \"I could tell you a joke, but you wouldn't get it.\"Does the fact that the original health worker and interview room, were different from those at the end of the movie not suggest it was a reality and at least some of the events did occur?Edit: There isn't \"every indication\" it was all in his head. The Joke was this wrecked, adopted child creating a boy just like him (Bruce Wayne). Another one of his \"jokes\" (visions/episodes/whathaveyou) was more than likely the killing of the therapist, hence the whacky running back and forth through the hallways with the single bodyguard. So the therapist more than likely sat in a room with this man alone, as is often depicted in film, but all she got out of him was hysterical laughing during an episode before he was brought back to his room.Edit: Another possibility is that some scenes were real, and some scenes, such as everything from after he shot Murray until the final interview scene, were in his head."

    {
      "question": "Where does Arthur get the bullets for his revolver? We saw that Arthur ran out of ammo during the subway scene, but then he had some when going on TV.",
      "answer": "This Question, like many others, is answered by the theory that - None of it was real. It's all in his head. Arthur is in Arkham. If Arthur was a killer and incredibly dangerous, would he just be sitting opposite his counselor, even if in handcuffs. Like Arthur said at the end \"I could tell you a joke - but you wouldn't get it.\"Alternatively, in the bag that Randall gave him, it looked like there were plenty of bullets, even if one doesn't assume that the gun came pre-loaded. And Arthur could presumably have bought more ammunition in the days between first getting the gun and killing Murray.There is also the possibility that the events of the subway killing happened differently than as portrayed. What we do know from media and the police were that 3 men were fatally shot, but not how many times. The events showing Arthur firing 8 rounds, none of which missed, could not have happened for two main reasons. The first is that his revolver only holds 6 rounds maximum. The second is that he could not have reloaded the weapon while also carrying his bag in the opposite hand. He would have needed to set this bag down in order to retrieve two additional rounds and insert them in the weapon. -- One could deduce that Arthur could have fired as few as 3 or 4 rounds, with the actual incident being less dramatic than depicted."
    },
    {
      "question": "The 3 guys in the subway attacked Arthur first. Couldn't he tell the cops he killed them in self-defense?",
      "answer": "He certainly could, but: (A) The police are not tasked with sorting out what's murder and what's self-defense; that's for courts to decide. They would have arrested him regardless of whether they believed him or not. (B) A competent defense lawyer (assuming Arthur could get one) could likely get the first two killings ruled justifiable homicides, but the third man he killed was retreating; pursuing him and finishing him off with malice aforethought as Arthur did is murder in the first degree according to the laws of every state in the USA. (C) Even if his lawyer could arrange some kind of plea-bargain deal to get his sentence for the third killing reduced, Arthur's using a gun he was not legally allowed to own (due to his being mentally ill) would also earn him some further prison time and civil penalties. (D) Arthur being mentally ill and therefore a rather unreliable witness, he'd have a difficult time getting anyone to believe his testimony, especially when facing in court the (probably) more affluent and better educated friends and families and employers of the three men he killed. (E) Unless he or his lawyer could somehow locate that woman the men were harassing and get her to come testify on his behalf, he'd have no one to testify to his claims but himself; and again, he's known to be extremely unreliable."

Brett Cullen and Joaquin Phoenix have an age difference of about 20 years, so this could realistically be true.However, it would imply a large deviation from the comics by making Arthur Bruce's brother. Director Todd Phillips has been very vocal stating that he and his team would be taking liberties with the character's mythos, so it could be open to interpretation."

      "answer": "No..he can read letters & his journal while haphazard in structure and style seemingly contains very few spelling mistakes . The line 'I hope my death makes more cents' is presumably meant a joke by Arthur, but in general means two things:1. His death or being dead would make more sense to him than his own life of living, OR II. He is presumpting condescending peoples ability to use the term 'cents' as a literate forecoxing of demeneation or banking on somebodies life makes it acceptable that they would even be living in the first place. Ergo, Hoping his life makes more cents being dead than living would argue that people just wouldnt care if he was dead on the ground in the first place. He even tells Murray \"if i was dead or laying down on the street, you'd walk right over me\"/.That's MY two cents ...."

      "question": "Why did Arthur do the suicidal self-shooting gesture to Sophie in her apartment?",

It's also a callback to the first friendly moment he had (or imagined having) with her, when they commiserate about how bad it is to live in an old building with problems like an erratic elevator, and she makes the gesture as a self-revealing way to show how sick of it she is. It could also be interpreted it as him threatning her if she told anyone he was in her apartment.At that point he probably was thinking of committing a suicide."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did Arthur suffer from depression?",
      "answer": "Throughout the film, Arthur appears to have depression which is displayed many times throughout: He lives a lonely and tortured existence, suffering from a mental illness that only alienates him further. During the opening scene, where Arthur is so depressed that he has to yank the corners of his mouth up into the shape of a smile, which just doesn't do the trick. And if viewed closely, a single tear is on his right cheek, smudging his makeup a bit. Immediately following is a scene where a group of hoodlums steal his sign when he's doing promotional work as a clown. Arthur tries running after them (calling for help and getting no response), which isn't easy given he's wearing oversized shoes. Just when he thinks he's caught up to them in an alleyway, they smash the sign over his face. Followed by beating him until all he can do is lay on the ground in pain. To make matters worse, he looked like he was genuinely enjoying himself before they stole his sign, not just faking a good mood for the job. Afterwards despite having bruises all over his body, his employer accuses Arthur of stealing the sign and dodging work because he finds people stealing a sign and beating him up over it too implausible, and quite clearly assumes Arthur is lying because he is mentally ill, before declaring the cost of the sign will be cut from his paycheck, Arthur just stares and smiles at him in tranquil disbelief and anger. Also whenever Arthur's condition causes him to uncontrollably laugh, in the most inappropriate situations that angers people he didn't mean to offend, with it visibly distressing and physically hurting him. Usually the Joker's laughter is portrayed as campy, terrifying, or some combination thereof. Here, we see Arthur struggle with his rattling laughter, trying but failing to control it as it tears through him. Also on several occasions, the sounds and facial expressions he makes are indistinguishable from uncontrollable sobbing. Like he's laughing to keep from crying, or trying to cry and failing. There's also the scene when Arthur is on the bus and starts playing peek-a-boo with a baby who is staring at him, which makes the baby laugh. The mother then tells him not to bother her kid (which is sad enough, because he was making the baby happy) and he starts having a laughing fit. When she asks what's so funny, he hands her a card explaining he has a condition. Think about that - he had a laminated card to explain his condition in the 1980's. That's how many times something he couldn't control bothered/annoyed/confused someone, that he had to go out and have a card specially made just to receive a modicum of understanding. To make it worse, the mother possibly doesn't even care about this explanation. She turns around with an annoyed look on her face while Arthur laughs, like it's an inconvenience for her. Or perhaps it's pity on the woman's face. Either way, the scene really hammers in how Arthur doesn't really have a chance in the world of Gotham. Possibly the crowning moment is when he gets his first stand-up gig. Arthur gets a case of the jitters, which triggers a laughing fit that goes for a whole excruciating minute where he can't even put two words together. It gets to the point where he's struggling just to breathe. This scene can hit home to anyone who's ever done stand-up comedy and/or got stage fright."

      "question": "Why didn't Arthur respond in shock to Sophie not knowing his name when he was in her apartment?",
      "answer": "It's indicated that Arthur himself never truly believed they were together, that's when we finally know that it had actually only been Arthur fantasizing about her all along.Alternatively, it could be that he was numb from so many traumatic events (beatdowns and tauntings, murdering people, investigation by the police, losing his job, losing/killing his mother, being mocked on national TV, rejection from the Wayne family, not to realize his whole abusive crazy childhood) that realizing Sophie didn't actually know him was just one more rejection and loss piled on.

      "question": "Why couldn't the police find Arthur after the subway shooting? He gets at least one call by the police because they want to question him.",
      "answer": "Even if the victims are rich, police are useless is still a big reason why everything went downhill, and as seen in the subway scene disgrunted citizens don't care if you're a cop they'll rough you up, so they likely need time to get a warrant and convince cops to go in the slums to make an arrest. Also because there were no cameras and no reliable witnesses to confirm the identity of the suspect. The police are pretty sure that Arthur did it, but they don't have confirming evidence yet, and don't want to be made fools because they caught a patsy. They want to slowly roast Arthur with repeated visits until he either snaps or confesses."

      "question": "How would Arthur and Bruce's rivalry work in the future? Arthur will be an old man by the time Bruce becomes the dark knight.",
      "answer": "As it is a stand-alone Joker is able to avoid this problem; some possibilities are: 1) Joker is not a physical threat by that point, simply a supervillain who uses traps, bombs and psychotically loyal goons. 2) Arthur's actual age isn't as old as Phoenix and he just looks that way because he's unwell and a smoker; Fleck could begin taking care of himself and be a villain for a very young Batman (depending on Canon Batman starts at 25, so if Fleck is just an old looking 35, he would be 52 when \"Year One\" takes place). 2b) would be Batman starts even younger, similarly to how the show Gotham is running, with a 40-something Joker a realistic threat to a teenage Bruce. 3) The name joker ends up being a title that Gotham's craziest, most dangerous and influential criminal takes over; this would allow for a \"Jokerverse\" where each style of Joker gets his day. Failed comedian turned anarchist murderer, mob boss using the insanity plea, a pure force of chaos and evil- Gotham's dark side personified. Todd Phillips' also indicates that this isn't necessarily The Joker we're seeing here. It could just be a Joker.Note that this problem also occurred in the Batman film of 1989, in which the Joker was said to have killed Bruce Wayne's parents, when Bruce was only a child."

The only evidence are the words of Thomas and Alfred (who would both have an obvious interest in denying that Mr. Wayne had any bastard children or ever engaged in affairs while married) and the papers Arthur steals from Arkham (which might well be sham evidence concocted to bury any danger of Thomas' reputation getting ruined from word spreading of him having an affair with one of the help, let alone that same help bearing him a child). To be absolutely fair, the Arkham case file is more evidence than just the word of a clearly deranged woman. We don't actually see Thomas doing anything wrong (other than being understanbly hostile towards a Arthur after the stunt he pulled on Bruce) that may suggest he is so amoral and corrupt that he would go into such illegal extents, instead of doing what real rich people do when they want to hide old shames (hire a \"fixer\" lawyer to quietly reach an economic agreement)."

    {
      "question": "Why does Arthur kill his mother? Does he feel she lied to him about his father? Maybe his madness going further? Perhaps even he wanted to end her suffering?",
      "answer": "Viewers have to consider that the lie goes deeper than just the father's identity, if that is a lie at all. Through the information he saw on the medical record - and he kills her after seeing that record - it turns out that she had let him be abused and beaten up since a tender age, which would probably be the cause of his mental and physical issues. In his line before the murder, he mentions her full name, and how he has not been happy a minute of his whole life, so the terrible childhood, which maybe now came back to him, is a real factor. Mentioning the comedy, so a play, might also imply a sort of detachment now that he understands that it was all a lie from the beginning and she's not even his real mother (if that's what he believes)."
