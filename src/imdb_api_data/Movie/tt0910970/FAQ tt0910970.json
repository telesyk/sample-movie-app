      "question": "What is 'WALL·E' about?",
      "answer": "After the Earth became too trash-covered to support life, all humans were invited on a five-year cruise aboard the Buy N Large (BNL) space liner Axiom after which waste-cleaning robots, known as Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class (WALL-E), were dispensed to the Earth's surface for clean-up. Seven hundred (700) years later, only one WALL-E (voice of ) remains on the planet, going about his job compacting trash into cubes and stacking them, with only his pet cockroach and a Hello, Dolly! (1969) (1969) video to keep him company. Then one day, an Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator (EVE) probe (voice of Elissa Knight) arrives to scout for any evidence that the Earth might be ready for recolonization. WALL-E falls in love with EVE and follows her back to the Axiom where the two embark on a mission to save the Earth. Edit"

    {
      "question": "Is 'WALL-E' based on a book?",
      "answer": "WALL·E is based on an original script by American screenwriter Andrew Stanton, who also directed the film. Stanton has said in interviews that the idea behind the WALL·E character was the last of the thoughts discussed at the now legendary 1994 lunch meeting where he, John Lasseter, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft came up with ideas that were central to many of Pixar's most iconic films. As Stanton described, it was \"the loneliest scenario I'd ever heard\" with a robot left on Earth, somehow the last one never switched off, endlessly doing his job. Stanton continued to think about and develop the character from that point onward and even \"procrastinated\" while working on Finding Nemo to write parts of WALL·E. He conceptualized possibly the most emotionally important physical characteristic of WALL·E, his camera \"eyes,\" when he was handed a pair of binoculars at a baseball game. He found himself completely enthralled by how just by moving the lenses up and down he could make the binoculars express different emotions, which ultimately became the primary way the character does so. The idea behind WALL·E therefore was first and foremost to imbue non-living items with life and emotions ranging from the most extreme loneliness to the most fulfilled love. As Stanton puts it, \"that challenge haunts all animators. We grow up thinking that our bike is cold when it's left out in the rain or that a leaf on a high branch is afraid of heights. WALL·E tapped into the pure possibilities of animation.\""

    {
      "question": "In what year does the movie take place?",
      "answer": "According to the year shown in the DVD exclusive short BURN·E, the story begins in the year 2805. Other time references given include the starting date of Captain Reardon's service (the apparent first captain of the Axiom) in the year 2105, as listed under his portrait, the captain's announcement of day 255,642 aboard the Axiom (celebrating of the 700-year anniversary of the original five-year mission), and directive A113 being sent in the year 2110 (\"nearly 700 years ago\"). Strangely, \"2815 A.D.\" is the title of the second track on the official soundtrack album, the first original song in the movie, the only apparent contradiction to the year 2805."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happened to all of the other WALL·Es?",
      "answer": "In the official production notes and interviews, writer/director Andrew Stanton has consistently said that the essential concept behind the character of WALL·E is \"what if mankind had to leave Earth, and somebody forgot to turn off the last robot?\" The BNL corporation initially had a plan to return to Earth. Based on Stanton's concept, it is likely that when their clean-up plan failed, they intentionally turned off all the WALL·E units, somehow missing only one."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was the WALL·E we meet the only one with a personality or did those others have personalities too?",
      "answer": "Stanton has said in interviews that he never really thought about how WALL·E got his personality or if the other WALL·Es had personalities too. We see in the story, however, a glimpse of how unsophisticated those personalities might have been when the character temporarily loses his memory and personality. This makes it seem as though, over time and perhaps due to his many self-repairs, along with his need for extreme independence to achieve his directive and his centuries of exposure to human artifacts, WALL·E develops a unique personality far beyond the basic level of interaction with his environment for which he was built. Another possibility, shown throughout the movie, is that the robots are generally not completely predictable machines, with something as simple as a break from routine causing them to show what we would call personality. One example is M-O, who shows what could be interpreted as either displeasure or excitement at being made to clean a 100% contaminated WALL·E. Another is EVE, who shows a personality in a variety of ways as she encounters things on Earth. Other robots wave, try new things, or show support for WALL·E as they weave in and out of his story."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was EVE sapient before she met WALL·E, or was it exposure to his personality that created hers?",
      "answer": "While EVE begins the story deeply committed to her directive, she already seems to be sapient and has a complex personality that includes emotions. She shows this personality in a number of different ways before she meets WALL·E. Examples include: (1) EVE seems to enjoy flying. Immediately after she becomes active, she begins following her directive to search for plant life. However, after she watches her ship depart, she stops her search for almost a minute of apparently nonproductive flight. (2) EVE is entranced by WALL·E's pet cockroach. As soon as she realizes it is not a threat, she reaches out to it, lets it climb all over her, and even laughs at the sensations it produces. The cockroach's relationship to WALL·E also seems to be part of the reason she decides that he, too, is not a threat. (3) EVE shows frustration, anger, and depression. As her search begins to seem fruitless and she is temporarily trapped by a magnet, she takes out her frustration on a ship. After doing so, her expression and body language indicate a sense of depression with arms slumped and eyes half shut. After that darker demonstration of her existing personality, in this seemingly vulnerable state, EVE finally takes the time to meet WALL·E, learn his name and function, and teach him to pronounce her name. She even giggles in a clear indication that she finds the way he mispronounces her name endearing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does EVE have a gun if she is supposed to be searching for life on Earth?",
      "answer": "When EVE probes were created by the BNL in the 2100s, they were given gun-arms. The primary reason for this was because of the possibility of needing to remove obstacles (for example, when EVE is trapped by a ship's electromagnet, and she escapes by blasting it away)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How could the plant grow without sunlight or get into a refrigerator that hadn't been opened for hundreds of years?",
      "answer": "The door to the fridge is actually leaning on the main body of the fridge, not attached or sealed, which is why WALL·E is able to get it out of the way with a single cut. Even if it were attached and closed, though, by their nature seeds find their way into all sorts of weird places. Seeds getting into a rusty old fridge that likely had holes and cracks all over it isn't too hard to believe. Seeds can be incredibly tough. In one well-known experiment, NASA exposed tomato seeds to the harsh environment of space, including cosmic radiation, for over five years. When brought back to earth and planted, most of them still grew normally. The intact parts of the fridge probably helped protect the sprouted plant from intense sunlight, dry air, and dust storms. Even so, it had pretty much just sprouted, and may well not have kept growing if WALL·E hadn't discovered it. As an important point of story resolution, we do finally see what it grows into during the credits, after all the help it gets from both robots and humans."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why were the people on the ship so overweight?",
      "answer": "The writers and filmmakers behind WALL·E have stated explicitly that the size of the Axiom's passengers and command staff was not because of obesity or lifestyle, but rather because of bone loss caused by the many years spent in microgravity. Stanton and co. researched what would happen to human beings after many years in microgravity (via NASA) and loss of bone density is one of the key things scientists told them."
    },
    {
      "question": "What were the names of the past captains of the Axiom and how long were their terms of service?",
      "answer": "According to plaques under each of the portraits in the captain's quarters, the Axiom has had 6 captains including our current, Captain McCrea. The past captains all served very long terms by modern standards of over 120 years, with some as long as 140. All are named for Pixar employees:Captain Reardon (named for Jim Reardon, writer), 2105-2245.Captain Fee (named for Brian Fee, storyboard artist), 2246-2379.Captain Thompson (named for Rob Duquette Thompson, animator), 2380 - 2520.Captain Brace (named for Maxwell Brace IV, story artist), 2521 - 2645.Captain O'Brien (named for Kevin O'Brien, storyboard artist), 2646-2774.Captain B. McCrea, 2775 to present (2805)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who is BURN·E?",
      "answer": "BURN·E is a small welding robot. He is shown briefly and comically frustrated when he is locked outside of an airlock at the end of WALL·E and EVE's dance scene. Similar to the animated short included on the DVD version of The Incredibles, Pixar tells the rest of his story in an animated short included on WALL·E's DVD release."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are there so few humans returning? Is the human race really that reduced now?",
      "answer": "There are almost certainly other ships, probably many other ships, though we are never explicitly told if humans survived on them as they have on the Axiom. The Axiom is described in 700-year-old advertisements as the \"jewel\" (i.e., the flagship) of a BNL fleet of ships. The CEO of BNL says in a short ad during the introductory sequence that ships are leaving for space \"every day,\" indicating there are likely dozens if not hundreds of such ships in space. The fact that they appear not to cluster together and do not communicate with each other is strange but not hard to accept, given that the other AUTOs are (presumably) continuing to follow directive A113 (full control of the ship) and are directed to \"stay the course\" and \"never return to Earth\". The CEO's directive A113 message is addressed to \"autopilots,\" plural. You also may notice that the audio of the CEO's recorded message to the captain changes tone abruptly when he says \"the Axiom\" while explaining that the ship will automatically return to Earth. This is likely intended to show that the same message exists on every ship to be triggered under the appropriate circumstances, with only the name edited in for each unique vessel. Whether the Axiom is capable of contacting its sister ships to rescind Directive A113, or issue a recall order of sorts (telling them that Earth is safe for human habitation once more and ordering their AUTOs to return immediately), is unknown at this point. On the DVD bonus features there are several BNL Shorts and one of them clearly shows several ships just like the Axiom taking off, showing that the world population has been split between many ships."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did WALL·E retain his personality after being damaged and having his motherboard replaced?",
      "answer": "WALL·E units and robots in general most likely would hold memories and other elements that define personality on some future storage medium functionally similar to a modern hard drive or solid state drive. Every component of WALL·E that we see is recognizably similar to modern technology, yet we never see anything that resembles an HD or SSD. We do not see one damaged or as part of the repairs EVE makes. It's reasonable to assume that means this part of WALL·E survives the attack. We do see a board replaced that might be his motherboard, a storage interface with an on-board cache, a self-contained memory unit, or some other very important piece of equipment. It could even be some means of regulating his electrical power source, given how he almost completely loses his charge during the attack that causes the damage but otherwise continues to function. Whatever this item is, when replaced it is possible that it took some time for his long-term storage medium to fill his working memory back up with data. It's reasonable that WALL·E continued functioning in a basic manner while this process was taking place, in a kind of \"recovery mode\". Once the recovery process was complete, WALL·E remembered and was himself again. It's worth mentioning, though, that EVE's love has a tangible, electrical form. Each time she \"kisses\" WALL·E on the forehead we see a small electrical spark, so there could be some crossover between the technical explanation and the thematic (love story) explanation. It is possible that EVE's kiss actually kick-started some important part of WALL·E's recovery process."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was M-O a rogue robot?",
      "answer": "In the scene when M-O was cleaning the EVE units and encounters WALL·E we see him step outside the white boundary. This mere action seems to indicate that he was no longer operating in his indicated parameters. So, yes he was a \"rogue\"."
    },
    {
      "question": "How was Operation Clean-up supposed to work?",
      "answer": "According to Andrew Stanton in the Behind the Scenes Preview at Amazon.com, the plan for Operation Clean-up is as follows. After the WALL·E units compact the trash and build it into towers:It then allows these large city-block wide sized incinerators that are on big tank treads, to sort of roll in, and like a hay baler with a big crane that can slice the towers down into digestible sections and incinerate them.So, in other words, the plan was to use large machinery to incinerate massive sections of trash at once, after the WALL·E units had cubed and stacked it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "Captain McCrea is able to shut off AUTO, allowing EVE to place the plant in the holo-detector which identifies the point of origin and hyperjumps the Axiom back to Earth. But WALL-E is severely crushed in the process of preventing AUTO from collapsing the holo-detector. Once back on Earth, EVE rushes WALL-E to his garage where she is able to make repairs on WALL-E from the spare parts he has stored there. When WALL-E's solar panel is recharged, EVE extends her hand to him, but WALL-E turns his back, not recognizing her or her gesture. Frantically, EVE tries to refresh his memory by showing him the light bulb and the Rubik's cube, but WALL-E simply adds them to his trash compactor and heads outside to collect more trash. EVE follows, calling his name and shaking him, but there is no response. Heartbroken, EVE intertwines her fingers with WALL-E's fingers and gives him an electric kiss. Suddenly, WALL-E's fingers tighten around EVE's fingers, and his eyes begin to click. \"Eve-ah?\" he asks. EVE replies with a slight giggle, and they put their foreheads together. In the final scene, McCrea shows the humans how they're going to learn to grow plants like vegetable plants and pizza plants. As the camera pans back, patches of greenery are shown springing up outside the city."

    {
      "question": "Is there a scene after the credits?",
      "answer": "Not in the original version, but animation during the end credits continues the story through imagery that mimics art periods throughout history. We see humanity rebuilding civilization on Earth and get an idea of EVE and WALL·E's ultimate fates. We also see an abridged retelling of the film with the characters portrayed in \"8-bit\" pixellation-style drawings. After the Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios logos is a BNL logo. The Regions 1, 2, and 5 DVD of the film contain an alternate version of the familiar Pixar studio animation, where Luxo Jr's lightbulb burns out rather than simply being turned off. WALL·E enters the picture, replaces the bulb with a CF (compact fluorescent) lightbulb and, while attempting to leave the frame, knocks over the letter \"R\" in \"PIXAR\". WALL·E then takes its place, with his hands forming the upper-right part of the letter and his compactor door taking the place of the letter's right \"foot\"."

    {
      "question": "Any recommendations for other movies by Pixar Animation Studios?",
      "answer": "If you like Pixar's animation in Wall·E, you'll certainly want to see some of the other Pixar productions, including (1995) and its sequels—Toy Story 2 (1999) (1999) and Toy Story 3 (2010) (2010)—and perhaps A Bug's Life (1998) (1998), Monsters, Inc. (2001) (2001), Finding Nemo (2003) (2003), The Incredibles (2004) (2004), Cars (2006) (2006) and Cars 2 (2011) (2011), Ratatouille (2007) (2007), Up (2009) (2009), Brave (2012) (2012), Monsters University (2013) (2013) and Finding Dory (2016) (2016).

    {
      "question": "Are there any references to earlier Pixar films?",
      "answer": "There are many. Apart from the conspicuous reference to A113 (an in-joke that appears in animations from many studios including Pixar) references include: (1) the trash cubes WALL·E compacts and stacks have a distinct similarity to the trash cubes in Monsters, Inc., (3) the Pizza Planet truck from Toy Story makes a brief cameo appearance amongst the junk which EVE scans for signs of plant life, The tag number of the \"Mother's van\" in Toy Story is A113. Rex the dinosaur can also be seen briefly amongst WALL·E's collection. (4) In the ending credit sequence the animated sea turtles and clown fish swimming are a reference to Finding Nemo, and (5) the robot mice on the lower trash levels of the Axiom are named REM·E, a reference to Remy, the main rat character in Ratatouille."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there any references to other movies?",
      "answer": "One of the major plot elements is WALL·E's endless watching of the 1969 musical Hello, Dolly! There are also references to 2001: A Space Odyssey, such as the use of Richard Strauss' \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" and the appearance and personality of AUTO. Also, in the short movie \"Burn·E,\" found in the DVD and Blu-Ray release, the \"hyperspace\" scene closely resembles that of 2001: A Space Odyssey's \"Star Gate\" scene."

    {
      "question": "What are the songs in the trailer?",
      "answer": "\"Aquarela do Brasil\" is played at the end of the trailer. The version used in the trailer is \"Central Services / The Office\" from Michael Kamen's soundtrack to Terry Gilliam's (1985). For the romantic interlude, Etta James's \"At Last\" is played. The French trailer uses \"Love Is in the Air\" by John Paul Young. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "WALL·E seems to share a likeness with Johnny 5, the robot from the Short Circuit movies, does he have any relation to him?",
      "answer": "In short, no. However, the director has admitted to having watched Short Circuit before and acknowledges that it may have subconsciously influenced the design of WALL·E. His body was designed for the eyes to show emotions, tank-like treads so he could handle all terrains, and a body with the ability to retract his head and limbs like a turtle. One minor feature of Johnny 5 that WALL·E does not share was a pair of metal shades over the eye lens. These covers functioned as both eyelids and eyebrows, and slowly moved (quite a bit) like butterfly wings. They were important to Johnny 5's look. The fact that WALL·E does not have them supports the director's account: WALL·E's lenses get damaged during the movie and he certainly could have benefited from \"lens lids.\" In short, the similarities are very remarkable although the director has stated that WALL·E is an original design."
    },
    {
      "question": "What's that middle dot in WALL·E's name and is the character to be typed out or inserted?",
      "answer": "The dot between the \"WALL\" and the \"E\" is called an interpunct. It was used to separate words in the classical Latin language long before the use of spaces. It is used for different purposes in a few modern languages, among them Catalan, Occitan, Georgian, and Japanese. In creating an XML or HTML document, the interpunct is rendered from markup for character entity referencing: \"&\" followed by either \"middot;\" or \"#183;\"—i.e. altogether \"·\" or \"·\". If you are producing any other type of document you can use a character map or other method to add the unicode character 0183 (00B7 in hex). On many machines running Microsoft operating systems, you can also produce it by making sure your number lock is on, then holding down Alt while typing \"250\" on your number pad (or when numlock is off: hold Alt, then 0183). On Mac OS X, it can be produced by typing option-shift-9. The \"Spanish (Spain)\" keyboard layout includes characters needed to type the Catalan language. To type the middle dot in this keyboard layout, press Shift-3. You can also, of course, just copy and paste it from somewhere else (like this FAQ). To read more about the middle dot, see the Wikipedia article Interpunct."

      "question": "Why is Shelby Forthright portrayed by a live actor while all passengers and crew on the ship are animated?",
      "answer": "Actually every human being from the past, including those on commercials, is portrayed by a live actor. This is explained through the portraits of captains in the Axiom's control room: as humans spent more time in space they began to lose their \"real-life\" shape and gradually look more like cartoon characters, due in part to the completely inactive lifestyle enabled by the ship. Keep in mind that Shelby and the other humans shot in live action are long dead. They are images of what humans looked like 700 years before the film takes place. Writer/director Andrew Stanton has also said in interviews that the musical sequences WALL·E watches \"set a precedent\" that meant all sequences from the past should be live action for consistency."

      "question": "What do the different robots' names stand for?",
      "answer": "WALL·E is short for \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class\" (and is referred to as \"Wally\" throughout the screenplay, which can be downloaded from the official site). EVE is short for \"Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator\", WALL·A is likely short for \"Waste Allocation Load Lifter Axiom-Class\" (or it could be \"Arkology-Class\", since the Axiom wasn't by far the only ship launched by BNL), and M-O is short for \"Microbe Obliterator\". AUTO (\"Otto\") is, of course, short for \"Autopilot\". Other robots whose names seem to be clever plays on words, but may not be acronyms or abbreviations include BURN·E (\"Bernie\", a welding robot), VAQ-M (a vacuum cleaner), VN-GO (\"Van Gogh\", a painting bot), PR-T (\"Pretty\", a beautician bot), HAN-S (\"Hands\", a masseuse bot), D-FIB (a defibrillator), L-T (\"Light\", a desk lamp), and B-RLA (an umbrella)."
