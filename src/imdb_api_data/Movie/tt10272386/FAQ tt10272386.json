      "question": "The picture aside Anthony's bed probably showed him along with 2 women believed to be his 2 daughters. One of them resembled Laura (Poots). But the other resembled The Woman (Williams) rather than Anne (Coleman). Laura would have made at least some sense as Anthony had described Laura to be resembing Lucy and with regard to how Anthony's fading perception of reality had been depicted throughout the movie.
