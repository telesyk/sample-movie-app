He has dementia and constantly forgets important life events and where things are around his flat, including his watch. He tells Anne he believes his caregiver stole his watch and that he will never move out of his flat. She tells Anthony she is moving to Paris to be with a man, which confuses Anthony since he does not recall any men in her life since the end of her marriage to James. Anne says that if he keeps refusing to have a caregiver, she will have to move him into a nursing home.\r\nThe next day, Anthony encounters an unknown man, Paul, in his flat. Paul says he is Anne's husband and that Anthony is living in their flat. Anne returns but appears to Anthony as a different woman. When a new caregiver, Laura, arrives for an interview, Anthony tells Laura he was a professional dancer and insists he does not need any assistance. Anthony later says Laura reminds him of his other daughter Lucy, whom he has not seen for a long time.\r\nAnthony is taken to a doctor and rejects the idea that he has memory problems. Later, he tells Laura how proud he is of Lucy, a painter. She tells him she is sorry about Lucy's accident, but Anthony is confused as he has no recollection of the accident. Over the course of the film, it becomes clear that Anthony has really been living with Anne for years, but believes he still lives in his own flat. After Anne comes home, she and her husband – who is sometimes called Paul and sometimes James, and appears as two different men – have an argument over a holiday that had to be cancelled because of Anthony's needs, and about Anne's sacrifices for her father. Paul asks Anthony how long he plans to stay in their flat and annoy everyone; this sequence of events is repeated later, and on the second occasion Paul slaps him.\r\nAnthony wakes up and walks out of the flat, finding himself in a hospital hallway. He remembers Lucy lying in a hospital bed with blood on her face. He then wakes up in a completely different bedroom, which is in a nursing home. His nurse arrives, who earlier appeared as both Anne and Laura, but identifies herself as Catherine. She informs him that Anne lives in Paris and visits on occasional weekends. Another nurse named Bill also visits, identical to one of the men who earlier appeared to be Anne's husband. Anthony breaks down in tears over his inability to understand what is happening to him, as well as Anne's disappearance. He says he wants his mother and that he is \"losing his leaves, the branches, the wind and the rain\". Catherine comforts him and tells him she will take him out to the park later.\r\nCast\r\nAnthony Hopkins as Anthony Evans\r\nOlivia Colman as Anne\r\nRufus Sewell as Paul\r\nImogen Poots as Laura\r\nOlivia Williams as The Woman (Catherine)\r\nMark Gatiss as The Man (Bill)\r\nAyesha Dharker as Dr Sarai\r\nProduction\r\nIt was announced in May 2019 that Florian Zeller was to direct a screenplay with Christopher Hampton based on his play. Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman were cast in the film. Olivia Williams, Rufus Sewell, Imogen Poots and Mark Gatiss joined later that month, with filming beginning on 13 May. Filming locations included West London Film Studios, and Hayes, Hillingdon.\r\nRelease\r\nThe Father had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on 27 January 2020. Prior to this, Sony Pictures Classics and Lionsgate acquired U.S. and U.K. distribution rights to the film, respectively. It also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on 14 September 2020 and at the AFI Fest in October 2020.\r\nIn the United States, the film began a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on 26 February 2021, before expanding on 12 March and then being available on premium video on demand starting 26 March, after originally being scheduled to be released on 18 December 2020. The film was released in India on 23 April 2021 and in the United Kingdom on 11 June 2021, delayed from earlier release dates of 8 January and 12 March in response to lockdowns as result of a second-wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The film was released in mainland China on 18 June 2021.\r\nReception\r\nBox office\r\nThe Father grossed $2.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $26.1 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $28.2 million.\r\nIn the film's opening weekend in the United States, the film made $433,611 from 865 theatres, finishing eighth at the box office. The weekend following its six Oscar nominations, the film made $355,000 from 937 theatres. Following its two Oscar wins, the film made $147,000 from 713 theatres, for a running total of $1.9 million.\r\nIn Spain the film made $171,901 in its opening weekend from 156 theatres, then $160,378 in its second and $54,901 in its third.\r\nCritical response\r\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 98% of 292 critics' reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.7/10. The website's consensus reads: \"Led by stellar performances and artfully helmed by writer-director Florian Zeller, The Father presents a devastatingly empathetic portrayal of dementia.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".\r\nWriting for Variety, Owen Gleiberman said \"The Father does something that few movies about mental deterioration in old age have brought off in quite this way, or this fully. It places us in the mind of someone losing his mind—and it does so by revealing that mind to be a place of seemingly rational and coherent experience.\" For The Guardian, Benjamin Lee wrote of Hopkins's performance: \"It's astounding, heartbreaking work, watching him try to rationally explain to himself and those around him what he's experiencing. In some of the film's most quietly upsetting moments, his world has shifted yet again but he remains silent, knowing that any attempt to question what he's woken up to will only fall on deaf ears. Hopkins runs the full gamut of emotions from fury to outrage to longing for his mother like a little child and never once does it feel like a constructed character bit, despite our association with him as an actor with a storied career.\"\r\nTodd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"The best film about the wages of aging since Amour eight years ago, The Father takes a bracingly insightful, subtle and nuanced look at encroaching dementia and the toll it takes on those in close proximity to the afflicted. Fronted by a stupendous performance from Anthony Hopkins as a proud in denial of his condition, this penetrating work marks an outstanding directorial debut by the play's French author Florian Zeller.\"\r\nWriting for Indiewire, David Ehrlich said: \"Zeller adapts his award-winning play of the same name with steely vision and remarkable confidence, as the writer-director makes use of the camera like he's been standing behind one for his entire life. ... In Zeller's hands, what appears to be a conventional-seeming portrait of an unmoored old man as he rages against his daughter and caretaker slowly reveals itself to be the brilliant study of a mind at sea, and of the indescribable pain of watching someone drown.\"\r\nWriting for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis said The Father is \"stupendously effective and profoundly upsetting\" and described it as a \"majestic depiction of things falling away\". The Guardian's Anne Billson ranked Hopkins's performance in the film as the best of his career.\r\nSelections\r\nSundance Film Festival: official selection\r\nToronto International Film Festival: official selection\r\nTelluride Film Festival: official selection\r\nSan Sebastián International Film Festival: Pearls section\r\nZurich Film Festival: official selection\r\nHamptons International Film Festival: official selection\r\nDinard British Film Festival\r\nAccolades\r\nPrequel\r\nA follow-up film, The Son based on Zeller's 2018 play, which is framed as a prequel to The Father, with Hopkins reprising his role as Anthony in a cameo and Zeller returning as writer and director, was released on 25 November 2022.",

The website's consensus reads: \"Led by stellar performances and artfully helmed by writer-director Florian Zeller, The Father presents a devastatingly empathetic portrayal of dementia.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 88 out of 100, based on 51 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\".</p><p>Writing for Variety, Owen Gleiberman said \"The Father does something that few movies about mental deterioration in old age have brought off in quite this way, or this fully. It places us in the mind of someone losing his mind—and it does so by revealing that mind to be a place of seemingly rational and coherent experience.\" For The Guardian, Benjamin Lee wrote of Hopkins's performance: \"It's astounding, heartbreaking work, watching him try to rationally explain to himself and those around him what he's experiencing. In some of the film's most quietly upsetting moments, his world has shifted yet again but he remains silent, knowing that any attempt to question what he's woken up to will only fall on deaf ears. Hopkins runs the full gamut of emotions from fury to outrage to longing for his mother like a little child and never once does it feel like a constructed character bit, despite our association with him as an actor with a storied career.\"</p><p>Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"The best film about the wages of aging since Amour eight years ago, The Father takes a bracingly insightful, subtle and nuanced look at encroaching dementia and the toll it takes on those in close proximity to the afflicted. Fronted by a stupendous performance from Anthony Hopkins as a proud in denial of his condition, this penetrating work marks an outstanding directorial debut by the play's French author Florian Zeller.\"</p><p>Writing for Indiewire, David Ehrlich said: \"Zeller adapts his award-winning play of the same name with steely vision and remarkable confidence, as the writer-director makes use of the camera like he's been standing behind one for his entire life. ... In Zeller's hands, what appears to be a conventional-seeming portrait of an unmoored old man as he rages against his daughter and caretaker slowly reveals itself to be the brilliant study of a mind at sea, and of the indescribable pain of watching someone drown.\"</p><p>Writing for The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis said The Father is \"stupendously effective and profoundly upsetting\" and described it as a \"majestic depiction of things falling away\". The Guardian's Anne Billson ranked Hopkins's performance in the film as the best of his career.</p><h4>Selections</h4><ul><li>Sundance Film Festival: official selection</li><li>Toronto International Film Festival: official selection</li><li>Telluride Film Festival: official selection</li><li>San Sebastián International Film Festival: Pearls section</li><li>Zurich Film Festival: official selection</li><li>Hamptons International Film Festival: official selection</li><li>Dinard British Film Festival</li></ul><h4>Accolades</h4><table class=\"table table-responsive table-bordered table-hover w-100\"><tbody><tr><th scope=\"col\">Award</th><th scope=\"col\">Category</th><th scope=\"col\">Recipient</th><th scope=\"col\">Result</th><th scope=\"col\">Ref.</th></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\"><span>AACTA International Awards</span><br><small>(<span>10th</span>)</small></td><td><span>Best International Actor</span></td><td><span>Anthony Hopkins</span></td><td style=\"background: #FFE3E3;

    "videoDescription": "Anthony is 80, mischievous, living defiantly alone and rejecting the carers that his daughter, Anne, encouragingly introduces. Yet help is also becoming a necessity for Anne; she can't make daily visits anymore and Anthony's grip on reality is unravelling. As we experience the ebb and flow of his memory, how much of his own identity and past can Anthony cling to? How does Anne cope as she grieves the loss of her father, while he still lives and breathes before her?",
