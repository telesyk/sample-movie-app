      "question": "Why do they have to carry the nitroglycerin to that plant?",
      "answer": "They need the explosive to blow out a burning oil well. There was an accident at the plant, and now they need to extinguish the fire. It's a common method to blow out burning oil wells by explosions. The explosion consumes all the oxygen around the oil well."
    },
    {
      "question": "What caused the nitro to explode?",
      "answer": "The movie doesn't give a definitive answer to the actual cause of the explosion. However, because nitro is extremely volatile and explosive, it could have been caused by any number of things, e.g. a bump or pothole in the road, veering too sharply or quickly in one direction, etc. It was said in the film, \"They probably didn't even know what happened.\""
