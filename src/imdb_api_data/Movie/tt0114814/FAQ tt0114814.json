    },
    {
      "question": "Where does the title come from?",
      "answer": "The title comes from a line in the classic film , where the corrupt police chief, anxious to cover up the murder of a Nazi officer, tells a subordinate to \"round up the usual suspects,\" meaning that the police should find a bunch of random criminals to be questioned. In the film, the criminals are rounded up without any evidence specifically pointing to them. The police are hoping to randomly get one of them to confess. Thus, they are the \"usual suspects.\" because they have been convicted of crimes that relate to the one for which they have previously been arrested. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Who are the \"usual suspects?\"",
      "answer": "The usual suspects are five small-time crooks who are brought together in a police line-up on trumped-up charges. There is Dean Keaton (), a corrupt ex-cop trying to go straight, crack shot Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), his partner Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollak) the hijacker, and Roger \"Verbal\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), a con artist crippled by cerebral palsy.

      "question": "Why did Söze have to kill Keaton and the rest of the group?",
      "answer": "Technically Söze didn't *have* to kill any of them. As none of the group knew his true identity. However the reasons may be as follows; First, Fenster tried to flee. So he had to be killed to show the others what would happen if they tried to run as well. Hockney, Keaton and McManus were likely killed so that they wouldn't be able to tell different stories of the events that happened. If Verbal is the only survivor, he could spin the narrative any way he saw fit. Also, because he worked so closely with the group, Söze may have felt they had seen too much as it was. Not to mention, they had all stolen from Söze, which is why they were brought together in the first place. While \"Kobayoshi\" explained that because they didn't know they stole from Söze is the only reason they weren't killed, that doesn't mean they would be spared forever."

    {
      "question": "What happened to the cocaine that was on the ship?",
      "answer": "There was no cocaine. When Kobayashi () blackmailed the five men, he said that it was their job to get on the ship and destroy the cocaine on board. Söze was using them as a diversion. While they were killing the other men on the ship and looking for the drugs, Söze sneaked onto the ship and killed Arturo (Castulo Guerra). Arturo was the one man who could positively identify him, so Söze needed him dead. Edit"

    {
      "question": "Are there clues to Keyser Söze's identity?",
      "answer": "Yes, there are some. One is Verbal's relative position on the night of the attack. He is hiding behind a stack of material on the dock. When Hockney is killed, Verbal would have been the closest person to him. In his testimony, shown in flashback, Verbal supposedly takes cover behind some large spools of rope on the dock as he observes Soze on the boat. However, when the camera zooms in on this area from the opposite side after the explosion, no one is seen peering through the ropes.In the opening scene, we see Keyser Söze look at a gold pocket watch and produce a gold cigarette lighter. Later, in the scene where the gang threatens Kobayashi, we see Verbal wearing a similar watch. He also collects this watch, along with a gold cigarette lighter, as he leaves the police station, despite having earlier demonstrated his inability to use a similar lighter during his questioning.In the interrogation, Verbal comments that when he gets dehydrated his urine becomes thick and lumpy due to a kidney condition. In the opening scene when Keyser Söze urinates on the fire, his urine is thick and lumpy.When agent Kujan begins to suggest that Keaton might be the one behind the hit on the docks, Verbal can be seen starting to smile. When Kujan comes around from behind Verbal and looks him in the face, the smile disappears, and Verbal continues to pretend loyalty to Keaton. During the interrogation throughout the movie, although it is easy to miss upon a first viewing, Verbal is seen glancing for a second or two away from Kujan or over Kujan's shoulder at the wall behind him in full view of wanted posters and advertisement flyers of names as Verbal is clearly making up the names of the mysterious associates and contacts such as \"Redfoot\" and \"Kobayashi\" when Kujan's questioning becomes more intense as it revealed that Verbal Kint is making up (on the spur-of-the-moment) aliases of his co-conspirators as he goes along.Söze is seen wearing a black fedora and trench coat on the boat. These are both seen hanging in Arturo Marquez's cabin. So it would make sense that Verbal snuck on to the ship, took the coat and hat after killing Arturo in order to finish off Keaton and McManus.Keyser Söze is described by Verbal as being of mixed Turkish/German heritage. \"Söze\" is Turkish for \"talks too much\", or \"verbal\". \"Keyser\" sounds like the German word \"Kaiser\", meaning \"emperor\", while \"Kint\" sounds like \"king.\" Director Bryan Singer has referred to the name as essentially meaning \"The king that talks too much.\"Finally, one might simply recognize that when Söze whispers, \"How ya doin' Keaton?\", at the start of the film, the voice is that of Verbal/Kevin Spacey. After being thrown on the ground Verbal slips, \"I did kill Keaton,\" though Kujan is shouting too loud to hear, and Verbal is able to correct himself by saying \"I did see Keaton get shot.\" Also, when they are listening to the men before the attack on the boat Keaton speculates that they are speaking Russian, Verbal correctly identifies the language as Hungarian, something Soze would obviously know."

    {
      "question": "Is the true identity of Keyser Söze ever revealed?",
      "answer": "Yes. At the end of the movie, US Customs agent Dave Kujan () concludes that Keyser Söze must be Dean Keaton. In an ironic twist, however, Söze actually turns out to be Verbal Kint. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Were the events told from Verbal's perspective a lie?",
      "answer": "Yes and no. Verbal tells Kujan the story as if he was simply Verbal Kint and not Keyser Söze. Verbal tells Kujan that it was his plan to rob the corrupt police officers without killing anybody. Then they fenced the goods to Redfoot, who then offered them the next job of robbing Saul Berg, which was set up by Kobayashi, etc. etc., which finally led to the events at the end of the film, leaving Verbal the only survivor. When pushed by Kujan, Verbal is adamant that Dean Keaton was his friend and that he wasn't the mastermind behind all the events. When pushed harder by Kujan and given all the facts, Verbal breaks down and admits that they all followed Keaton from the beginning, and that he planned and executed everything. At the very least, the names of those involved, such as Redfoot and Kobayashi, were clearly invented by Verbal on the spot, and his descriptions of where he was when the others got killed during the attack on the boat all appear to be untrue.However, we see that the person who he referred to as \"Kobayashi\" was real, as he picks Verbal up at the end. So it's likely that most of the events that happened were true, but certain aspects may have been fabricated or several of the names changed in order to keep Kujan from being able to trace anyone who had actually been involved with Verbal, thus preserving Söze's identity. For example, the incident when \"Kobayashi\" meets with the five of them, gives them their police files, and gives them the assignment of robbing the ship of the supposed cocaine and money, was likely true. In addition, the robbery of Saul Berg and the New York's Finest Taxi Service, and the fact that all five men were rounded up by the police for a lineup, were certainly true, as such facts could be easily confirmed with a few calls to the LAPD and the NYPD. It should also be noted that one of the keys to lying well is to stick as closely to the truth as possible. In this case, it's likely that many of the broad outlines of the story which Verbal told are true."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "At the end of Kujan's interrogation of Verbal Kint, Kujan looks over the details strewn across the bulletin board, recognizing most of the names from Verbal's account of the events, just as an artist's depiction of Keyser Söze makes its way to the police station via fax. It is Verbal Kint. As Verbal walks down the street, his leg straightens out, his fingers uncrimp, and he lights a cigarette. Kujan runs from the building in an attempt to catch Verbal, but the man called \"Kobayashi\" has picked him up. Keyser Söze has once again disappeared."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could someone else have been Keyser Söze?",
      "answer": "It's entirely plausible that all the evidence that pointed to Verbal Kint being Keyser Söze was red herrings, and someone else could have been the mythical crime lord. For example, Verbal doesn't look old enough to have been married with children. However, it wouldn't be too shocking if he was simply Keyser Soze's son continuing the family tradition. The story about Soze shooting his children is true, but Verbal survived by hiding when the thugs came in. In fact, Kobayashi could reasonably have been Keyser Soze. He is clearly in his late 50s or early 60s, making a larger window for him to become one of the most powerful criminals in the world. He's less amazingly steeped in American culture, vernacular and geography for a Turkish crime lord compared to Verbal, he never gets directly involved in his crimes, let alone enters a police station and gives clues that could ruin a cherished identity, preferring instead to have those jobs be carried out by middlemen. Under this theory, Verbal is a conman who is Keyser's infiltrator who helps him stay on top, and also even plays the part of Keyser sometimes, such as on the boat, while \"Kobayashi\" remains completely behind the scenes and his face remains a secret. While not the intended theory, it is plausible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Keyser Soze win in the end?",
      "answer": "More or less. Soze has wrought revenge on those who stole from him, wiped out the opposition and killed the one witness who could identify him. However, the police now have his photograph, fingerprints and DNA and another witness (the surviving Hungarian gangster) who can implicate him. They can also backtrack through the various aspects of the story, checking up on Edie Finnegan's client list, the owners of the hijacked gun truck etc to generate possible leads on Soze's organisation. However, Soze/Verbal Kint will likely go into hiding, plus with his underworld connections, he will likely stay hidden or more likely re-surface again later, somewhere with a different alias and maybe a different face should he likely change his appearance through plastic surgery, but this is all speculation."
