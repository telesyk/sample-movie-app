      "title": "M for masterful",
      "content": "A treat for the eyes and exercise for the brain, \"Dial M For Murder\" is Hitchcock's second \"drawing-room perfect murder\" movie, after \"Rope\", the latter a darker and more sinister affair altogether. Hitchcock himself in interviews played down the quality of this movie, amongst other other things indicating that it was treated almost as a warm-up for the more ambitious \"Rear Window\" which immediately followed it in his career.However. it actually has a lot going for it, being beautifully shot in luminous colour, extremely well acted in almost every role and peppered throughout with those eye-catching and brain-satisfying flourishes which so distinguished the director from the rest.Yes, it is very set-bound, betraying its stage origins and likewise very talky, especially on exposition, but it keeps the viewer alert throughout and delivers a neatly satisfying conclusion. I do wish Hitchcock could have done better with his back-projection unit (an old-fashioned, jarring trait he still hadn't grown out of by \"Marnie\" some 10 years later) and I occasionally found the constant too frivolous background music an intrusion, but it's well paced throughout, helped considerably by an on-form cast.Ray Milland is excellent in a kind of darker Cary Grant type persona, Grace Kelly (who'd want to murder her?) goes convincingly from loveliness to wretchedness while it's pleasing to see Robert Cumming to the fore, recalled by Hitch for the first time in over a decade (since \"Saboteur\" in 1942). The actors playing the would be murderer and nosey police inspector are just fine too.About those flourishes..., perhaps the most famous being the changing spotlight on Grace Kelly's doomed face as her trial is condensed into just a few terse minutes and of course the murder scene itself, even if one can't imagine her extended stabbing gesture being strong enough to cut through Swann's jacket far less kill him stone dead, but I also enjoyed the raised tracking shot looking down on Milland as he explains his plot to Swann and particularly the parting shadows of lovers Cumming and Kelly at Milland's unexpected approach.Yes, it's old fashioned Hollywood movie-making, but it's old-fashioned Hollywood movie-making at its best and in my opinion an unjustly overlooked effort from the Master."

      "title": "The stage-originated dialogue sings with intelligence, wit, and an easy transition to the screen",
      "content": "There is a lot to admire about Alfred Hitchcock's \"Dial M for Murder,\" and I do hold the film with a great deal of admiration and respect. However, what I adore about the movie the most (more than the cinematography, the suspense, the acting, and even the direction) is the work by screenwriter Frederick Knott. Mr. Knott based the screenplay for \"Dial M for Murder\" on his successful stage production, which I have never seen, but am told contains almost all of the words we hear in the film. And the words are music to the ears. They sing with intelligence, wit that Mr. Hitchcock certainly found attractive, and, best of all, an easy transition to the screen. Many times when a stage production goes to film, as far as I am concerned, the results, even if good, are uneven. Frequently, the dialogue and restricted set space allowed tend to give off the impression of a filmed play, not a cinematic experience. Another Hitchcock film, 1948's \"Rope,\" though valiant, interesting, and successful, attempted this and suffered from this difficult struggle.But the dialogue, put on film here, is exceptional. I write this review having seen \"Dial M for Murder\" two or three times and wanting to see it once again. Many reviewers, myself included, have tried watching films with the sound off. I want to try the opposite. I want to close my eyes and just listen to the dialogue because it's so strong. The MacGuffin conversation at the beginning, with a perfectly cast Ray Milland blackmailing a perfectly cast Anthony Dawson into murdering a perfectly cast Grace Kelly is brilliantly written by Mr. Knott. It was clearly from a stage production, as it explains the plot background in great detail, and goes on for the better part of twenty minutes. Both men are fleshed out, giving us their personalities and individual tendencies. And even though \"Dial M for Murder\" pretty much stays on just one small set (an apartment in London, in which we see mostly the foyer, a little of the bedroom, and just a glimpse of the kitchen), what happens there is so fascinating that we do not really want to venture out into the city.And that is just the setup. The dialogue remains insistently interesting and clever throughout the picture. It also has that subtle, dark sense of humor that Alfred Hitchcock was keen on. It also has the ironic touches, such as when Mr. Milland, as the jealous husband, kisses his unfaithful wife on the night she is to be murdered, and tells her: \"Goodbye, my dear.\" The audience, having been given every single little detail about the scheme and how it is to unfold, cringes with a dark realization that Mr. Hitchcock might just go through with Mr. Milland's plot. Mr. Hitchcock, as the director, is also due tremendous credit for his trademark of creating tension. Screenwriter Knott brilliantly lays out for the audience, not the victim, how the murder will go through, but Mr. Hitchcock's camera dutifully follows everything as the scheme goes along. And, before we realize it, if something starts to go wrong, we become scared and tense. And you can imagine my guilt when I realized I was feeling scared that a plan to murder someone just might not go through. It's Mr. Hitchcock's gift at work.Dimitri Tiomkin, a very good film composer, hits all the write notes; that includes knowing when he needs to tell his violins and trumpets to shut up. Robert Burks' cinematography is also strong with effective usage of shadows and streaks of light. Colors are omnipresent. And even though \"Dial M for Murder\" was shot with the intent to be seen in 3D, it is hardly evident. When I first saw the film, in much superior 2D, I did not mind the lamps and such in the foreground, such as when one bisects the screen between Ray Milland and Anthony Dawson during the opening sequence. I just thought it was a clever piece of filmmaking and misc en scene, not a cheap gimmick like in most 3D movies today. \"Dial M for Murder\" is a near-perfect movie of its kind, pumped full of smart dialogue and dazzling energy. This is one of the few play-to-movie transition that I have seen where I have suddenly become eager to see the original stage production."

      "title": "The perfect film for the perfect murder...",
      "content": "After earning an Academy award nomination for her performance in John Ford's 1953 tale of romance and adventure, \"Mogambo\", the beautiful actress Grace Kelly proved that she was way more than just a pretty face and that there was real talent behind her image. However, what truly took her career to new levels were three now classic films she made directed by the legendary Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Under his direction, Kelly made an integral part of the Master's films, becoming the perfect embodiment of Hitchcock's idea of a female protagonist. While Kelly debuted two years earlier in the classic Western \"High Noon\", one could say that it was Hitchcock who really introduced the beauty and talent of Grace Kelly to the world. \"Dial M for Murder\" was the first of Hitchcock's films with Kelly, and a movie where once again the Master returns to a familiar theme: the perfect murder.The movie is the story of Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), a former tennis player married to the beautiful and wealthy Margot (Grace Kelly) and living in an nice apartment in London. Life is good for Tony, until he discovers that his wife is cheating on him with an old flame of her, famous crime novel writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). After that discovery, Tony spends a whole years plotting the perfect way to murder his wife in order to inherit her money, carefully planning every detail of the crime. When Mark visits London again, Tony finds the perfect chance to set his plan in motion, and as planned, he recruits Charles Swann (Anthony Dawson) to kill his wife. However, bad luck and a sudden change of events will test Tony's plan's infallibility as, just as Mark points out, human action can originate flaws even in the most perfectly devised plan.Like most Hitchcock's films, \"Dial M for Murder\" was an adaptation of another art-form, this time a popular play by Frederick Knott. As Knott was also the writer of the screenplay, the movie remains extremely faithful to the play, although of course, not without its differences. Knott's script is wonderfully constructed, as like in the play, the dialog is witty and simply captivating, with many twists and turns that spiced up the complex plot and keep it from being boring or tiresome. An interesting feature of the movie is that oddly, there are no black and white morality in the characters, and it's easy not only to sympathize with Margot (despite she being cheating on her husband) but also to sympathize with Tony (despite he wanting to kill his wife), as the characters are wonderfully developed with very detailed personalities.It seems that Hitchcock's knows that the dialog is the highlight of the play, as he deliberately focuses on his actors and uses an elegant camera-work to frame the whole movie inside the apartment. The movie literally is shot entirely in one single room (only two other sets are used, and only briefly), but Hitchcock's classy way of using the camera allow a highly dynamic flow that never lets the movie be tiresome. This is also very helpful as Hitchcock just lets his characters keep speaking, carefully describing actions and events (when other directors would use flashbacks) in a similar way to a what the real play would be. While this approach could easily get boring, Hitchcock's use of colors and overall visual imagery simply creates the perfect medium to allow Knott's dialog to shine.Without disrespecting John Ford or Fred Zinnemann, I think that it was Hitchcock who finally could allow Kelly's talent to shine beyond her physical beauty. Grace Kelly makes her character shine with her subtle and restrained performance, specially showing her skill in the second half of the film. While often Kelly receives top honors in this movie, it is actually Ray Milland who makes the whole movie work with his suave and charming \"villian\". Milland's performance is simply terrific, making his character nice enough to win the sympathies of the audience, yet still frighteningly intelligent as the mastermind of the plot. John Williams appears as the Inspector in charge to solve the complex puzzle, and delivers a classic performance as the Enlgish gentleman decided to find the final answer. Only Robert Cummings seems miscast as Mark Halliday, although a lot of his weak performance could be blamed to Milland, Kelly and Williams overshadowing him with their excellent work.In many ways, \"Dial M for Murder\" shares many things with \"Rope\", as not only the two films are based on successful plays, they are also about committing the perfect murder and oddly, they are both \"experiments\": while \"Rope\" was conceived as a \"movie in one take\", \"Dial M for Murder\" was done as 3-D movie. Sadly, the interest in 3-D was dying when the film was released, so few theaters carried the movie complete with the gimmick; a real shame, as Hitchcock's use of the technology, unlike most 3-D films of its time, was conceived as a way to enhance the claustrophobia of the Wendices' apartment instead of using it to merely shock the audience with \"stuff coming out of the screen\" (as seen in for example, \"House of Wax\"). While not too fond of the gimmick, Hitchcock truly gave it a good and intelligent (albeit subtle) use to it.\"Dial M for Murder\" is probably less celebrated than the Master's most famous movies, the fact that it came out the same years as \"Rear Window\" (again with Grace Kelly) may have had something to do with it too. While a subtler and more restrained tale of suspense, this is still the Master at his best, as the movie proves that when he was at the top of his game, no other director was comparable to him. 9/10"

      "title": "Excellent",
      "content": "What gets me about this film every time I see it is just how simple it is. The witty urbanity of the dialogue goes without saying (hem), the acting is stagily impeccable, and the direction by Hitchcock is limited by the small sets but masterful for all that.Cold Ray Milland plans and sets up the murder of his demure but faithless wife Grace Kelly by a virtual stranger who is urged on by the stick of exposure of his misdeeds and the carrot of GBP1,000 in used notes. Of course all of his convoluted plans go horribly or thankfully wrong, depending on your point of view, leading to an even more convoluted revised plan. When first seen when young I wasted my time because I wasn't paying attention at the critical moment so missed the point and didn't get it: the key is how did the baddie get into the apartment? It's incredibly verbose, being from a stage play after all and at times it seems nothing more than a radio show with pictures. The long scene setting and verbal sparring by Milland and Anthony Dawson is superb to hear - it's fascinating for its relentless poetry, and of displaying a now-dead world. I could never understand the attraction of 3D movies, least of all with this particular attempt, or why Kelly was continually uglified by the Hollywood machine when she never looked lovelier than in here when she was playing stressed out throughout.I wonder if Hitch remembered the jokey murder scene he did in 1930 in Elstree Calling when Jameson Thomas realised he was murdering in the wrong apartment? Turn that key you have and go in, it's a remarkably literate film and as intricate inside as any lock."

      "content": "Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player, unhappily married to Margot (Grace Kelly), correctly guesses that she has been cheating, with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Mark writes crime stories. Unbeknown to Margot and Mark, Tony knows about the affair, and wants to teach Margot a little lesson, by taking away the thing that is her life. But, being too guileful to do it himself, Wendice blackmails one of his old school friends into murdering her, and the essential thing to doing it is his latchkey.Dial M for Murder succeeds on many levels, and it is largely thanks to some superb dialogue, written from a tricksy-yet-capable script that never gets too deep. The cast are a treat. Ray Milland is an absolute gem, extremely sly and dispassionate, yet a character so full of self-assurance that one almost sides with him. Grace Kelly completes her great year (she gave an Oscar-winning performance in The Country Girl and also starred in Rear Window) by emanating the poised, beautiful being, that is vulnerable, yet oddly unassailable. And it's weird in that even though she's cheating on her husband, you care for her a lot more than him (although that could do with the fact that he's trying to kill her...) And John Williams, as the police detective, is quite wonderful.Alfred Hitchcock manipulates and enthrals his audience here like the master that he is. Each scene has a sense of direction, great pacing, and is staged realistically. Stunning full colour photography and a haunting, atmospheric score from Dimitri Tiomkin complete this great package. The ending, when it comes, feels a little too nice to be truly realistic, but that is my only major quibble with an otherwise highly entertaining, thrilling movie."

      "title": "Fantastic Hitchcock murder mystery",
      "content": "Another excellent Hitchcock film, just one of the many that the director made which exceeded all my expectations. This murder mystery has a twist - we know the identity of the culprit from the start, it's just a question of waiting to see whether the cast work it out or not. The film takes place in a single location, a low key apartment, much like the Audrey Hepburn thriller WAIT UNTIL DARK. It's a slow paced and talky affair with an absolutely intricate plot that's likely to tie you up in circles if you don't watch it closely enough, but of course that's part of the fun.Personally, I thought the script was superb - one of the best, ever. Every little detail has been worked out and even if there are a couple of weak explanations along the way, you can easily forgive them thanks to how enjoyable watching the twists and turns play out is. The clever title refers to the pivotal scene, a sterling set-piece of suspense and murder, in which the lovely Grace Kelly is menaced by a sinister thug. Ray Milland is the deliciously slimy anti-hero and I love his stiff upper lip and confident air of self-assurance that propels him along throughout the movie. John Williams, a carry-over from the stage play on which this is based, supplies the much-needed comic relief and Anthony Dawson is as delightfully sinister as he's ever been.The fun from this film comes from watching Hitchcock ratchet up the suspense in numerous unexpected ways - such as the simple turning of a key in a lock. There isn't a cliché in sight, just strong plotting and decent scriptwriting. I even enjoyed this over the Hitchcock film I watched previously, NORTH BY NORTHWEST; it's one of those films where I wouldn't change a thing. I know I'm gushing, but this is a real treat. NB. I've recently re-watched this film in 3D, but that aspect is almost needless, merely adding depth to a few sequences; there's only one stand-out bit (during the attempted murder) so I wouldn't go to the trouble, personally."

      "title": "Not Hitchcock's best, but definitely a film not to miss!",
      "content": "Alfred Hitchcock is a wonderful director, directing classics such as Psycho, North by Northwest and Rebecca. While not his best, Dial M For Murder has so much to recommend it. First of all, is the breathtaking cinematography, which is nearly always the best thing in a Hitchcock film. The script is a gem, showing that you are capable of anything, and most of the time, it is very tense and rarely slips. That said, my only complaint, is that one or two scenes such as the ending do fall flat, compared to the rest of the film. However, the film also has a wonderful music score, and fantastic performances from the entire cast. Ray Milland, an actor I really want to get more familiar with, is excellent as Tony Wendice, the husband planning to murder his wife, and make it a perfect murder. As Margot, the beautiful Grace Kelly is the picture of beauty and vulnerability in a wonderful understated performance, perhaps outshining her co-star. Everyone else acquitted themselves well too, even Robert Cummings as Mark Halliday and John Williams as Inspector Hubbard. Overall, an excellent film, not Hitchcock's best, but well looking out for. 9/10 Bethany Cox."

      "title": "Hitchcock's perfect film of a non-perfect crime ...",
      "content": "With \"Dial M For Murder\", the Master signs another classic of mystery, starring for the first time, the actress who'd become the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, Grace Kelly. And as much as I appreciated the much more acclaimed \"Rear Window\", I sincerely believe this is one of Hitchcock's finest achievements, which is saying a lot considering his glorious oeuvre, but \"Dial M for Murder\" takes a special place in my heart, because it represents for many reasons, the typical Hitchcockian film, by many standards.I. Dial M for MurderThe Murder takes place right in the middle of the story and like in \"Psycho\", it's defined by what precedes and what follows, it's the emotional reward of a patient but powerful build-up while the resolution is an intelligent case of manipulation. The build-up is the construction of a perfect crime, Tony Wendice, played by Ray Milland, presents to the killer, a remarkable Anthony Edwards, the killing's plan as if it was a simple technical operation, following an incredibly methodical scheme, admirably meticulous if it wasn't for the purpose of killing. Hitchcock's masterful direction creates a plot within the plot, at a point you wonder if you're watching the adapted play within a film, or a film that transcended the confined setting of the play. And the second and crucial element of the build-up subtly hints the fact that there's always a human factor that undermines any attempt of perfectionism. So, when comes the time of the murder, we have these two parameters, we know how it should happen, but we keep in mind that whatever must go wrong will go wrong. How? When? Where? This is what the whole first part of the suspense is about.II. Dial M for MistakeWhat could have been a lazy exercise of adaptation becomes in the hands of the Master, an extraordinary thriller confined in an elegant room sometimes welcoming, sometimes claustrophobic. The handling of the space and the various objects that occupy it, a telephone, sockets, scissors, keys, the way the camera shows them or hides them till the right moment is crucial in the way they organize what would lead to the fatal mistake. We only see what the characters can see and Hitchcock's manipulative effects consists on the way he lets the human factor affect the story only during the villainous parts. As much as we don't really care for the love story, because Christopher Hummings who plays the lover, Halliday, is probably the least charismatic of all, we sort of root for the villains, because of that 'humanity' displayed by the mistake. The point is that the murder is so well crafted, that there's a little evil voice inside us that wishes it could work, but again, this is Grace Kelly, and the sight of that creature in danger immediately reverses the rooting process, and then while her hands desperately seek a providential help, one pair of scissors theatrically conclude the heart of the film and the ruthless killer, becomes a worthless killer, before falling as a victim, or a collateral damage at best. The mistake is not just a plot device, it's Hitchcock's cynical insertion of humanity in a rather cold and emotionless mindset.III. Dial M for ManipulationThere's an interesting trivia about the title's translation in French: \"The Crime Was Almost Perfect\", which conveys the inevitability of human factor like fate in Greek tragedies. It is, no pun intended, the key element of the evolution and resolution of the plot, when Wendice will exploit the mistake to his advantage. Tony Wendice is impressive, because he's simply predicted everything, and he puts the level so high, that even Halliday couldn't accuse him, although, in the way he deconstructed the murder when trying to convince Wendice to find an alibi to save his wife Margot from execution, he concluded on what could have been the true motive of the murder but he was not in the same caliber than his opponent, hence the entrance of Detective Hubbard, played by an elegant, suave and scene-stealing John Williams. And it's only justice, that he could outfight Wendice by using his very weapon, manipulation. It's all about manipulating objects, space and people and on that level, Wendice found his archenemy.IV. Dial M for MillandRay Milland is perfect as the quintessential upper class villain, elegant, sophisticated and absolutely and totally unflappable, and I use the word 'perfect' as the reference to the French title. A perfect murder needs a perfect villain whose perfect scheme wouldn't be undermined by any external factor, except something under his own control. The casting of Milland also works because he's the one who outshines the other characters, his wife is the victim, the man he hires also appear as the victim, when he tries to kill Grace, you can look on his eyes, that he was a 'casting' error, Milland also underestimated his wife's strength as she managed to overcome her fear and become the killer. But Milland is the only one who doesn't change, totally unflappable, he's the pillar of the film, and the film is so confident that even when he's caught, he doesn't flinch an eye.V. Dial M for MelodramaThe film also allows to insert some melodramatic elements to engage our sympathy toward the couple, but it's clear that this just works as the foil to justify the murder, and inspire some sympathy toward Milland, when you see him with Margot, all in white, in the opening scene, then she's wearing a bright and dazzling red dress with Halliday. In one minute, Hitchcock masterfully highlighted the treachery that would inspire Tony's crime. The love will be Halliday's motive to fight for innocence but again, it's only with the same weapons that Wendice could've been defeated. so whether it's for murder, manipulation, Milland or melodrama, you know you'll dial a definite M for Masterpiece."

      "title": "Retooling the perfect murder when it turns out to be imperfect",
      "content": "Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is an aging tennis pro who learns that his wealthy wife (Grace Kelly as Margot) has a lover (Bob Cummings as Mark). Tony figures out what might have led his wife astray and fixes it - he gets a real job with a real boss. But what if his wife divorces him? He'd get nothing! Realizing that getting a job may have enlarged his wife's respect for him but not diminished her affection for the lover, he spends a large amount of time figuring out a perfect way to kill his wife so that he can inherit her money. Tony has nothing personal against Margot and her infidelity, he just can't take the chance of winding up penniless. He can't do the job himself - the husband is always the prime suspect in such matters. So, he must find someone who will be willing to do the job for him. He's not the type who hangs with organized crime types, so he has to find someone already guilty of murder but yet untouched by the law and get that person to agree to do the job for him.It sounds perfect. Tony even has the lover with him as an alibi the night the murder is to occur. But everything does go wrong, and now Tony has to retool his perfect murder. Who will kill Margot for Tony? The law of course! Watch this great little thriller and see what I'm talking about.Most directors lose a step after they are in their 50's. There is just something about their creativity that just fizzles, and I say that as someone who is 55 myself. But here Hitchcock is at age 55 doing some of his best and most clever work. This one is so ironic it could be considered a film noir if not for the elegance of the players, the setting, and that great score.Just one thing that nobody ever seems to talk about much - did anybody else want Tony to get away with it just a little? He does play it icy cold and smiling throughout, but when he makes the phone call that sets everything in motion, you can see the regret in his face - the fact that he hates that this is the way that it must be. Meanwhile my sympathy was not with the cheating wife and especially the false friend Mark Halliday. The guy was sleeping with a man's wife while pretending to be his friend, even carrying on a kissing session with her while the husband went down the street for an errand. If you're going to steal someone's wife, let it be a stranger's. Don't shake the guy's hand, eat the guy's food, and accept his hospitality and take his wife behind his back too. Maybe Hitch wanted the audience to be conflicted though, maybe he was trying to add to the complexity of the situation with this added dimension. At any rate, watch this if you get a chance. In fact, watch it more than once. You'll always see something you didn't see before."

Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 adaptation was the first and certainly the best one even if the master himself considered it one of his lesser efforts. \"Dial M for Murder\" will be remembered as Hitchcock's first color film and the first of three thrillers he had made with Grace Kelly, the future Princess of Monaco, in the prime of her beauty and her talent. Using color proved to be very effective in the film. The first two scenes featuring Kelly wearing a white morning dress in the idyllic scene with her husband Tony and right after that kissing passionately her American lover, writer (Robert Cummings) in the red dress, immediately, without many words tell the viewer that the story of passion, deception, betrayal, and ultimately, murder will follow. Ray Milland (Tony Wendice) is a surprisingly sympathetic villain (which is perhaps not surprising from the actor with talent, charm, and charisma that equal and remind a lot of both Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart) who knows about his wife cheating and decides to teach her a lesson by plotting a very clever murder which will make him a sole heir to her money (she is a wealthy one in the family). His plan is perfect and almost works but Margot managed to not only escape the murderer but to turn the table on him while stunned Wendice is on the phone and listens how his well thought of plan collapses. Wendice is very resourceful and he proved to be a master of improvisation because it took him a few minutes in a cab to switch to a plan B that turned a terrified victim Margot into a cold-blooded murderess. Now it is up to seasoned and shrewd inspector Hubbard (John Williams) to find the crucial piece of evidence and to solve the case.As always with Hitchcock, his directing is impeccable, the camera rarely leaves Wendice's apartment but the film is never claustrophobic which is the case for many plays' adaptation. It breathes and moves freely and we almost forget that we are in the same room for close to two hours. I would not call \"Dial M for Murder\" my favorite Hitchcock's film but it is enjoyable, clever, and witty thriller with the interesting twists, outstanding performances, and more than one truly memorable scenes."

      "title": "One of Hitchcock's best thrillers.",
      "content": "1954 was a big year for Grace Kelly. She played in Hitchcock's classic \"Rear window\" and she won an Oscar for best actress in \"The country girl\" and most people tend to forget that she starred in yet another classic, \"Dial M for murder\". Starring Grace Kelly, Ray Milland, and Robert Cummings, it is simply one of Hitchcock's finest movies of all-time. In fact, I would consider it to be my second favorite Hitchcock movie ever, my first being \"Psycho\" (although I haven't seen \"Rear window\" yet). Margot (Grace Kelly) is married to Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player. However, she has been seeing another man named Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Mark writes crime stories. The two of them think that Tony doesn't know about their relationship but they're wrong; Tony has known about this relationship for one year and seems to have had enough of it. So when Mark, who lives in New-York, comes to London to see Margot, Tony wants to go out with Mark and his wife. But the night of the event, Tony is unable to go. So he tells Margot to take Mark out and to have a good time. The only problem is that Tony doesn't really have something that's keeping him from going out with Margot and Mark. He has another plan, the plan being to blackmail one of his old college friends that has become a small time crook into murdering his wife. What follows this is pure entertainment at its best. As usual, Hitchcock masterfully directs this movie and has the right actors to do the job. Ray Milland and Grace Kelly deliver very good performances and surprisingly enough, Robert Cummings does a rather good job in his role of Mark Halliday, the American crime novel writer who accidentally stumbles on the answer. But it is John Williams who steals the show with his great performance as Inspector Hubbard, the detective who holds the key to the whole mistery. He is simply excellent and pretty funny when he is supposed to be. Another of his great performances is in \"Witness for the prosecution\" where he played Brogan Moore, Charles Laughton's very good friend and seconding lawyer in the case. As for \"Dial M for murder\", well it's one of those movies that anyone should see at pretty much any cost."

I was riveted to the, let's face it, preposterous plot from beginning to end. Ray Milland is a credible monster in elegant and civilized clothing. Grace Kelly, a peach as the unfaithful wife who stays home to cut newspaper clippings of her husband's past glories. Yeah, right. Robert Cummings has always been a mystery to me. A popular leading man with a long career. He only exudes a campy, if lightweight vibe that almost works in comedies and when he's in a supporting role - My Geisha and What A Way To Go with Shirley MacLaine are good examples. Here as Grace Kelly's secret lover, I don't know what to say. John Williams. very funny again as the Scotland Yard inspector, the same character to a T he played in Midnight Lace with Doris Day or was it his twin brother? In any case, no Hitchcock fan can afford to miss this filmed play, filmed by one of the undisputed greats."

      "title": "Space, Distance, Entry",
      "content": "I recently saw this again, but I will make this comment on a viewing I had many years ago.I was sponsoring some research on human interfaces, and the center of expertise at the time was coordinated by an Air Force Lab out of Dayton Ohio. Some of the more clever guys at the lab had connections with hobbyists in the area, and also with local film enthusiasts connected with the city artfilm theater. They'd arranged for a reconstruction of the three-D version of this. I made a special trip for what was billed as the only week ever this would be shown.It was originally filmed in 3D, using an unusual process. Two cameras made two color prints. These were delivered together to the theater and shown with two synchronized projectors on the same screen through polarizing lenses. Polarized glasses allowed the viewer to see color 3D.Almost immediately after release, the process was abandoned because the projectors required amazing skill and were extraordinarily complicated, expensive and unreliable. To reconstruct the original effect, several years went into the location of most of the original projectors so that parts could be cannibalized to create the complete kit of Siamese twin projectors. Some missing precision parts may have been fabricated in a spooky government research lab; I cannot say. That was only the first impossibility.What had happened shortly after the film was released over 50 years ago, within a few months, was that the left and right prints were separated and distributed as \"ordinary\" versions. To reconstruct a pair, you need to have every single frame match. But no prints had all frames complete. Some had been edited by exhibitors for various reasons like time. Others had been broken and respliced and some of those repairs even reversed. Some had frames snipped to create publicity stills. Still others had both some left and some right elements.It apparently was a tremendous effort to scan all prints a frame at a time and reconstruct a matched pair. A previous 3D version had been released, but it was no help, in fact unwatchable. It reduced the process to the older black and white and didn't do the matching this team did. Its horrible, and not even 3D in some places.So I made a special trip to see this in Dayton as it was intended. Hitchcock made this in his spare time while preparing for his masterful \"Rear Window.\" It was already a hit play, and his contribution was to design the blocking for 3D. Its important because Hitchcock was a master in advancing the notion of a spatial camera, a space-savvy eye. Some of what he did here is not only extraordinary on its own, but it can be seen as a sort of sketchpad for some of the indirectly referenced effects on \"Rear Window.\" So if you are interested in the world, then you are interested in film in space, and then \"Rear Window,\" and as a result this in 3D.I not only saw this, but arranged to have the optimum seat in the house. And the place was packed with some of the most enlightened viewers I knew and the swelling of sighs at points was palpable. It was an extraordinary experience. The vision research lab was destroyed shortly thereafter because of Republican actions in Congress. I believe the reconstructed projection machinery was effectively lost forever, so the window may have closed to see this properly.You'll have to extrapolate the 3D effects from a two-d print. Its not impossible I suppose. I'll give you some clues. He places the camera in one of three modes, alternating among them depending on whether we are colluding, witnessing or dissecting. (The trial scene is excluded from this.) Obviously, these viewer modes are interleaved appropriately with which character we conspire with: the husband (a performer), the boyfriend \"mystery writer,\" or the detective. Its easy to work out and quite thrilling to see how he has \"dialed\" the vision.This is a replacement comment, the original having been deleted (along with scores of others) by a reader unhappy with comments elsewhere I made about an unrelated actor.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

      "content": "In London, the wealthy Margot Mary Wendice (Grace Kelly) had a brief love affair with the American writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings) one year ago while her husband and professional tennis player Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) is traveling in a tennis tour. Tony quits playing to dedicate to his wife and finds a regular job and she decides to give a second chance for their marriage. When Mark arrives from America to visit the couple, Margot tells him that she had destroyed all his letter but one that was stolen in a depot; then she was blackmailed through letters but she had never retrieved the stolen letter. Tony arrives home and claims that he needs to work, and asks Margot to go with Mark to the theater. Meanwhile Tony calls the scum Captain Lesgate - aka Charles Alexander Swann (Anthony Dawson) that studied with him in the college and blackmails him to murder his wife, so that he would inherit her fortune. But there is no perfect crime, and things do not work as planned by Tony.\"Dial M for Murder\" is one of the best thrillers of cinema history, with a theatrical story supported by an excellent screenplay and top-notch performances. Ray Milland is superb in the role of the Machiavellian and cynical Tony Wendice; Grace Kelly is extremely gorgeous and sweet in the role of a wife in the 50's; and John Williams is great in the role of the efficient and fussy Chief Inspector Hubbard. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is in the picture of Tony's reunion. In 1998, Andrew Davis remade this movie with \"A Perfect Crime\", with Michael Douglas, Gwineth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Disque M para Matar\" (\"Dial M for Murder\")"

      "title": "Superior Hitchcock with an exquisite Grace Kelly",
      "content": "This is a fine example of the kind of mystery that little old ladies from Pasadena (or Russell Square) adore. Perhaps Arsenic and Old Lace (1944) starring Cary Grant might be comparable in its gentile and bloodless ability to glue us to the screen. This is certainly one of Hitchcock's best, but most of the credit must go to a devilishly clever play written by Frederick Knott from which the movie was adapted. (He also wrote Wait Until Dark (1967) starring Audrey Hepburn.) Hitchcock does a good job in not tinkering unnecessarily with the material. He also has the exquisitely beautiful Grace Kelly to play the part of Margot Wendice. Ray Milland plays, with a kind of high-toned Brit panache, her diabolical husband, Tony Wendice, a one-time tennis star who married mostly for security. John Williams is the prim and proper Chief Inspector Hubbard. He lends to the part a bit of Sherlock Holmesian flair. One especially liked his taking a moment to comb his mustache after the case is solved. Robert Cummings, unfortunately plays Margot's American boyfriend as inventively as a sawhorse. For those of you who might have blinked, Hitchcock makes his traditional appearance in the photo on the wall from Tony Wendice's undergraduate days. The fulcrum of the plot is the latchkey. It is the clue that (literally) unlocks the mystery. There is a modernized redoing of this movie called A Perfect Murder (1998) starring Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow in which a similar business with latchkeys is employed. I am not very good with clues so it was only after seeing that movie and Dial M for Murder for the second time that I finally understood what happened. Follow the latchkey! Of course I was too distracted by Grace Kelly to fully appreciate such intricacies. I found myself struck with the ironic notion that anyone, even a cuckolded husband, might want to kill Grace Kelly or that a jury might find her guilty of anything! She remains in my psyche America's fairytale princess who quit Hollywood at the height of her popularity after only five years and eleven movies to become a real princess by marrying Prince Rainier of Monaco. Something was lost there, and something was gained. She was in essence the original Jackie Kennedy Onassis. I think, however, that the old saw about the man who marries for money, earning it, might apply to American princesses as well. At any rate, Grace Kelly's cool and sublime bearing was on fine display here. Hitchcock cloths her in discreet nightgowns and snug (but certainly not clinging) dresses that show off her delicate figure and her exquisite arms and hint oh so coyly at her subtle sexuality. She was 25-years-old, stunningly beautiful, and in full confidence of her ability as an actress. She had just finished starring opposite James Stewart in another splendid Hitchcock one-room mystery, Rear Window (1954), and was about to make The Country Girl (1954) with Bing Crosby for which she would win an Oscar for Best Actress. So see this for Grace Kelly who makes Gwyneth Paltrow (whom I adore) look downright gawky, and for Ray Milland whose urbane scheming seems a layer or two of hell removed from Michael Douglas's evil manipulations. By the way, the \"original theatrical trailer\" preceding these Warner Brothers Classic videos is what we used to call the \"Coming Attractions\"--that is, clips directly from the movie and a promo. You might want to fast forward to the movie itself."

      "content": "Hitchcock does Experimental Theatre That's pretty much to most befitting description you could give to \"Dial M for Murder\"; one of the Master of Suspense's most acclaimed but also  do I daresay it  most overrated achievements. The entire film takes place in one single location, as if you're watching a stage play, and there's also the experimental use of unusual camera angles and bizarre compositions, which proved that even the untouchable filmmakers like Hitchcock were attempting to be innovative in order to face the competition with the skyrocketing success of television during the early 50's. Personally, I have to admit I thought of \"Dial M for Murder\" as a very intelligent and competent but nevertheless severely underwhelming thriller experience. Every tiniest detail in this production is flawlessly taken care of, but the wholesome is just so damn lifeless! Every single character stands there talking as if they have a dozen of knives stuck in their backs and daren't move a muscle. Frederick Knott's screenplay is tight and highbrow, but since he adapted it from a stage play (his own), the movie is exaggeratedly talkative and the limited possibilities to switch sets rapidly makes it tedious as well, regardless of all the photography gimmicks.Former tennis star Tony Wendice developed the ideal plot to murder his unfaithful wife and rake in her family fortune. He truly thought up a seemingly waterproof and meticulously all-inclusive scheme that involves blackmailing an old college buddy turned petty crook into committing the vile act whilst Tony is out partying with his wife's lover. But, like one of the characters correctly states, the perfect murder doesn't exist and the more definite a plan looks, the more likely it is for important details to go wrong. Tony's plan does indeed go horribly wrong, but the cagey villain nevertheless comes up with an ingenious alternative plan on the spot. A couple of aspects about \"Dial M for Murder\" are undeniably pure genius. The whole build up towards the actual murder sequence, for instance, is nail-bitingly suspenseful and made unforgettable thanks to the creepy music. Then there are two performances that easily qualify as brilliant, namely John Williams' portrayal of the witty and typically British police detective and  foremost  the terrific Ray Milland as the dangerously sagacious psycho Tony Wendice. In fact, Milland's performance is so deeply impressive that you actually cheer for him and secretly hope that his diabolical plan of will succeed, if only just because the characters of his wife (played by Grace Kelly) and her lover are so annoyingly wooden and dull! \"Dial M for Murder\" is a highly compelling and smart film, but by no means a masterpiece and I sincerely doubt it ever would have made it into the top 250 if it hadn't had Hitchcock's name in the title."

      "content": "Undoubtedly, \"Dial M for Murder\" has a clever plot: Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) plans \"the perfect murder\" to do away with his wife Margot (Grace Kelly), who cheated on him with novelist Mark (Robert Cummings). He blackmails an old schoolmate into committing the crime and plants clues to mislead the police. But when things don't go according to plan, Tony has to plant new clues and think of another explanation to give the detectives, so that suspicion doesn't fall on him.The trouble is, the plot is the only interesting thing about this movie, and the characters are defined solely by how they can affect the plot. For instance, Mark writes mystery novels only because this explains his ability to \"read\" the crime scene. Most of the movie's dialogue is expository: long scenes where the characters debate the minutiae of evidence found at the scene, without an interesting subtext. The movie is known for taking place almost entirely in the Wendices' living room, and Hitchcock does a good job of varying the camera angles to make you forget there's just one set. But he did this even better in \"Rear Window,\" his other 1954 film.Admittedly, Milland gives an enjoyable performance as the villaintruly a guy you love to hate, a clever and smiling sociopath. But Kelly and Cummings are surprisingly boring for a pair of adulterous lovers. Kelly also proves herself the ancestor of all those female horror- movie characters who go investigating strange noises in their best lingerie.\"Dial M for Murder\" is lightweight without actually being funnya fatal combination. Though serious concerns (adultery, murder, the death penalty) underlie the story, we're never made to feel that they are really consequential. It's a cold and mechanical movie, which subordinates everything else to the demands of an intricate plot. Contrast this with something like \"Rear Window,\" whose plot is simple and lacking in twists, but whose characters are vividly drawn and act as though their stories really meant something. Having a clever solution to a mystery does not a great movie make."

      "content": "Ray Milland schemes to knock off his lovely wife (Grace Kelly) in order to support his flagging bank balance...His cause is \"justified\" by the fact that his wife is guilty of cheating on him...Milland develops a carefully constructed murder plan, contacting Captain Lesgate (John Williams), an old college classmate operating illegal ventures, to whom he outlines his murder scheme and then blackmails into carrying it out... The movie takes off from there as an intense character battle between three different characters... Tony, done by Ray Milland in outstanding performance, is icily intense and incredibly wild. He is easily the best of the three... Grace Kelly & Robert Cummings both pale in comparison, although Grace is slightly better, for the merely reason that her character is left for to do the least amount of truly suspenseful acting...The murder is set up and is deliciously evil: The defining moment is when Ray Milland wipes clean every object he touches as he explains to Anthony Dawson how to carry out the murder of his adulterous wife, thus not incriminating himself... They discuss the closing of the screen door to the porch, the placement of the golden key, and the time it will take his woman to answer the distracting phone call...Grace Kelly is the smart but vulnerable Margot... She begins her role dressed in bright crimson reds but as the film progresses and finds herself accused, her outfits become darker... Kelly is ingénue enough to be sympathetic but also tough enough to be respected... Her most memorable image was on the phone, oblivious to the assassin behind her... Robert Cummings does not fare at all because of his comical face... He is the weakest cast member bringing so little to the table... John Williams is excellent as the dangerous murder weapon tricked by a clever scoundrel... but he somewhere along makes one fatal mistake...Anthony Dawson is absolutely brilliant, delightful as the eccentric Chief Inspector watching how the easy-talking husband is trying to cover his tracks... As soon as he arrives on scene to investigate the murder, there's an instant feeling of electricity... Here's a guy who can read human nature from a mile away... He takes compassion on Kelly, but unfortunately, the two don't partner up as in cop buddy movies...The film, however, belongs to the sinister Ray Milland, the cold logic husband who designs the murder to look like a routine burglary gone wrong, and leads Scotland Yard into believing his wife is guilty of deliberate murder...Milland, a genteel charmer with an icy murderous side, is perfect as Tony Wendice... If ever there was a demonstration of venality, Milland's Tony Wendice was it: courteous on the outside, devious on the inside... We see his cheery domestic manner with his wife... He blithely sends her out for the evening with her lover, then without breaking his stride sits down at the telephone and calls Swan, the man he intends to enlist for the murder... There is something chilling about the way in which Milland operates in these scenes: Once Swan arrives, the polite smile never leaves Milland's face as he switches gears from exchanging pleasantries to blackmail and murder.. The entire scene was shot from the ceiling...'Dial M for Murder' holds its grip pretty well... Hitchcock provides the tension in many directorial tricks: Margot's unexpected change in plans for the evening; a hiding place for a key blocked by Mark at a critical moment; a stopped watch; an occupied telephone box; Margot's wavering hand holding the telephone that almost blocks Swan's access to her neck; Tony taking the key out of Swan's pocket and even briefing his wife what to tell the police...'Dial M for Murder' is a classic stage murder thriller... It never reaches the heights that 'Rear Window' did, but it has to be one of the most brilliant stage thrillers ever written... The score, composed by Dimitri Tiomkin, is both eerie & precarious...\"Dial M for Murder\" is a film that makes you pay attention. It is a definite must-see!"

      "content": "Dial M for Murder is a well chosen vehicle for Alfred Hitchcock, very similar to Rope. A suspense thriller set in the London flat of married couple Ray Milland and Grace Kelly, it had a very successful run on Broadway, 552 performances from 1952 to 1954. Unlike Rope, Hitchcock did briefly give the audiences in a couple of instances a break from the one room set of the play.Although shot in Hollywood, Hitchcock used a few members of the British colony to give the film proper authenticity. The character of Grace Kelly's paramour is American and Grace seems to have improved her British accent from Mogambo. The remake of Dial M for Murder was disappointing because of all the additions to a very simple suspense drama. The key here is that both Ray Milland and Grace Kelly so polite and civil to each other, like any other upper class couple. Then in conversations with other characters, Kelly with paramour Bob Cummings and Milland with Anthony Dawson the audience finds out their true feelings. It's all so genteel and very British, the completely American setting of the Michael Douglas film, A Perfect Murder was the last thing from perfect.Kelly's fallen for Bob Cummings, she realizes Milland is a wastrel, a word I wish would come back into use. Milland realizes he's drained the wife dry or coming pretty close so he hires an old college acquaintance Anthony Dawson to murder Kelly. Or rather blackmails him into it. That scene where he blackmails Dawson is one of both Hitchcock's and Milland's screen highlights.On Broadway, the parts that Milland, Kelly, and Cummings have were played by Maurice Evans, Gosti Huber, and Richard Derr respectively. Hitchcock retained from the Broadway cast Anthony Dawson and John Williams as the police inspector. In the case of Williams I should say THE police inspector. John Williams won a Tony Award on Broadway for his part. He set the standard as far as I'm concerned, maybe even more than Alastair Sim, for a British detective. Calm and detached, Williams goes far beyond duty requirements in relentless pursuit of the truth.Milland's scheme is a tricky bit of business involving his and Kelly's latch keys to their apartment. Quite ingenious in how Williams puts it together."

      "title": "Dial A For Adultery",
      "content": "This is considered a \"sophisticated\" crime film and it does have some interesting dialog and a story that keeps your interest. You have to pay attention, particularly at the end when the British police inspector explains how he figured things out.Ray Milland is the big star of this show, being in almost all the scenes. This kind of suspense movie is unheard of today - a thinking man's gentleman as the main bad guy - with little action in the film. That wouldn't be a success today. It was re-made in 1998 but had more twists and action scenes added.In this film, as in that re-make (A Perfect Murder), I found myself rooting for the husband. In this case, it was Millland, although he was a bit cocky.Note: It's a sad comment that Hitchcock, who didn't seem to have a lot of principles, made Robert Cummings - who was an adulterer in this film having an affair with Milland's wife Grace Kelly - into a \"good guy.\" Nobody in the film challenged him on what he was doing. Apparently, adultery was okay with the filmmakers here. At least in the re-make, they made the adulterer into a scumbag (although they made the cheating wife into a sympathetic character! No matter who makes this film, they are still clueless when it comes to what's right and what's wrong!.)"

      "title": "Kill Grace Kelly,,,Really?",
      "content": "This is an intense drama involving a plot by Ray Milland to get his hands on the money his wife has. His only method for managing this is to kill her. Of course, he can't do it himself. That would be terribly obvious. He must enlist a killer to do this. Grace plays a beautiful but passive woman who stays at home and sews. She is kind to her husband when she shouldn't be. One would think her the perfect target. But something goes wrong for Milland and Grace becomes the target of the police. Milland, like many Hitchcock villains, walks a fine line to maintain his safety. HItchcock builds incredible tension here and we know that somehow things will work out. But how? By the way. What's in the sewing basket?"

      "title": "Kind of slow but still pretty good Hitchcock",
      "content": "Suave, debonair Ray Milland wants wife Grace Kelly killed for cheating on him with bland Robert Cummings. He sets it up...and everything goes wrong.The script is pretty obviously from a stage play and most of the movie takes place in one room. Also the ultimate resolution was more than a little silly. Still this is not bad. I saw it in 3-D and 2-D. In 2-D this is slow and dull...3-D actually helps it. The camera is constantly shooting people in the background from behind lamps, couches, chairs etc etc. It adds a great feeling of depth to the surroundings. Hitchcock (wisely) avoided throwing things at the camera--there are only two instances of this: When Kelly is attacked her hand flies up to the camera--it was so real for half a second I almost reached up to help her! Also when someone holds out a key to the camera it comes right out of the screen at you. Hitchcock didn't want the 3-D--he was ordered by studio heads to shoot it that way. Still, he DID manage to use it in an effective way.The acting is almost completely great; Milland is fantastic--very smooth and suave as the villain; Kelly is just visually stunning and also gives out a good performance; John Williams is just terrific as an inspector trying to figure the crime out. Only Robert Cummings is not that good--he's bland and blank-faced the entire time. You really wonder what Kelly ever SAW in him!I like it but I think it drags quite a bit in the second half. I was getting a little bored. Seeing it in 3-D definitely improved the picture. Also it contains one of the most shocking murders in a Hitchcock film--right up there with \"Psycho\"!So it's worth a look--try seeing the 3-D version. I give it a 7."
