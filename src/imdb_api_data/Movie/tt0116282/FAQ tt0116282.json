      "question": "What was Carl Showalter doing in the car park (the one he didn't want to park in) with the white car, he was removing the snow from the number plate... why?",
      "answer": "He was swapping the plates on the parked car with the car he was driving. So if the police were to run the plates of his car, it wouldn't come up as the dealer plates. Remember, that Showalter and Grimsrud killed a trooper that had pulled them over. If he radioed in their plates then there would be an APB to look for that specific license plate."

      "question": "Is \"Fargo\" based on a true story?",
      "answer": "No. The \"this is a true story\" opening is not true, but was included by Joel and Ethan Coen to set a tone for the story. After all, at the end of the credits, one can see the standard \"This movie is fictional...\" legal clause. However, there were two separate cases, one in the 1960s and one in the 1970s, in Minnesota that bore many similarities to the storyline of Fargo. They are discussed in the trivia section, and as the Coen brothers are native Minnesotans they would have been aware of the cases, two of the most famous in Minnesota criminal history. Maybe there is something to those cases mentioned above, but the Coen brothers were mainly influenced by the 1986 murder of Helle Crafts, in Connecticut. Her husband murdered her, froze the body, dismembered the corpse with a chainsaw, put the pieces through a woodchipper, then scattered the remains that came out of the woodchipper. This same case also had an influence on a late 1980s horror movie called Woodchipper Massacre."

      "question": "Did a Japanese woman die because she believed the movie was true?",
      "answer": "No. A story appearing on The Guardian website confirms that the rumor of a Japanese woman—Takako Konishi—dying because she believed the story of Fargo to be real and subsequently froze to death searching for the case of money is simply untrue. It seems more plausible and believable that she did indeed die for the love that she had lost, as is suggested by the letter received by her parents, weeks after her death."

      "question": "Why did Shep Proudfoot tell Jerry that he didn't know Carl Showalter?",
      "answer": "It's likely that Shep did know Carl and was simply lying to Jerry. As we see when Shep busts in on Carl having sex with the escort, Carl calls him by name and didn't even seem to be alarmed at his entering the room. The place was likely Shep's apartment that Carl was staying at while in town. Shep, furious that Carl and Grimsrud's activities were getting traced back to him. The big question is, if Shep knew Carl, why did he lie to Jerry? We can only speculate, but it's possible that Shep referred Grimsrud to Jerry and Grimsrud decided to bring Carl in on it. So Shep just pretended to not know him in order to avoid any blame."

      "question": "What was with the scene where Marge visited with Mike, the Asian man she went to high school with? It seemed irrelevant.",
      "answer": "It's never fully explained in the movie, but there are subtle hints that the scene did have a significant role in the plot; Mike's fragile emotional state obviously startles Marge. After her friend informs her about Mike's problems and the fact that he was never married to Linda as he said, you can see that she becomes very sad and concerned about him. This is most evident in the scene where she is eating Hardee's in her car. As she is thinking about this, her mind apparently wanders off into other areas including the case she is working on. At the very end of that scene, you can see a slight but noticeable expression on her face that indicates a light bulb just went off in her head. This is because she has connected Mike's frantic behavior with the similar, though much less severe, behavior by Jerry in her first meeting with him. You will recall that Jerry displayed a certain amount of nervousness that would have illustrated to someone looking closely that he was a bit panicked (for example, pausing and remarking about Brainerd instead of answering her question about whether a vehicle had been stolen). Marge apparently didn't notice it at the time but after thinking about her encounter with Mike she is then able to connect the dots. Soon after, she goes back to speak with Jerry again. It is also thought that Marge, although being an experienced police officer, realizes she may not always know when she is being lied to. After discovering that everything Mike said to her was a lie, she questions her police work and thinks that maybe Jerry was lying to her as well. This is why she goes back to question Jerry again."

      "question": "What exactly was Jerry trying to accomplish with his schemes?",
      "answer": "Let's do a little character evaluation on Jerry:1. Jerry is shown to be spineless, inept and incompetent in pretty much everything he tries, a hapless loser who tries but just can't get anything done right. The Coen Brothers have described Jerry as an \"amateur criminal\". This is first evidenced in the scene where Jerry is finalizing a sale for a new car to a couple and the man is infuriated that Jerry added the $500 TruCoat onto the price of $19,500 and charged the customer for it even though the man specifically stated he didn't want it. Instead of Jerry conceding and taking the cost off the man's bill, he says he'd go talk to his boss about it. However seeing as Jerry is the boss (he later tells Marge that he is the sales manager), we see that he steps into the break-room to talk to a co-worker to make it seem like he just spoke to \"his boss\". When he comes back, Jerry says he could get $100 knocked off the cost of the TruCoat, infuriating his customer even further.2. We also see that Jerry's father-in-law Wade, who owns the car dealership Jerry works at, pretty much despises him and makes little effort to hide it. Wade does not like Jerry because he is aware of Jerry's craftiness or of the thought that Jerry may have married his daughter, Jean, just because he is wealthy, which is later shown that with the exception of his and Jean's son, Scott, Jerry shows little or no concern or affection for both his father-in-law or his own wife.3. We can assume Jerry was likely involved in some sort of business scheme or schemes where he lost a lot of money, because he apparently didn't know what he was himself getting into. It is speculated that sometime before the events in the film, he created fake invoices for vehicles he \"sold\" at the dealership even though they didn't actually exist.4. Jerry sent the sold invoices along with an insurance loan request off to the dealership finance company GMAC by using a batch of non-existent dealership vehicles as collateral with illegible VIN numbers... somehow hoping they wouldn't notice. The finance company, GMAC, calls Jerry at least twice on-camera to confront him about the accounting irregularities and wanted the VIN numbers as evidence that the vehicles he is using for collateral exist or else they would pull the loans on the vehicles which total $320,000. The reasons for Jerry doing this remain unknown. Speculation from various viewers say that Jerry probably embezzled money from the dealership bank accounts and then borrowed the money from GMAC to replace the money he stole. Another speculation is that Jerry wanted the $320,000 loan to pay off other creditors he owes money to, or that he either spent or gambled the $320,000 loan away for personal use (though there is nothing in the film to suggest that Jerry has a gambling problem). The mostly likely reason is that Jerry floated the loan and used the embezzled money to provide his family with modest and fancy living accommodations; the house along with the furniture, household items, etc.5. Clearly, Jerry knew that this plan only had a limited run so, through the association of a mechanic employee and ex-convict, Shep Proudfoot, Jerry meets and hires Grimsrud and Showalter to kidnap his wife and demand a ransom of $80,000 from Jerry's father-in-law which Jerry will split with the kidnappers so Jerry could show as proof of car sales for GMAC. Jerry tries to call off the kidnapping at one point because he thinks that a real estate deal he brings to Wade's attention will get him out of the bind he is in financially. But Wade takes the deal solely for himself and offers Jerry a measly finder's fee. Jerry is too late to call off the kidnapping anyway and so Jerry tells Wade that the ransom is $1,000,000 (so that Jerry can use $320,000 of it to pay back GMAC when they demand their money back, and probably to spend the rest for personal use as well as give Showalter and Grimsrud their $40,000).6. Through a course of events, which includes Grimsrud and Showalter shooting and killing a Minnesota State Police trooper who pulled them over for not having temporary vehicle tags on their car (followed by Grimsrud chasing down and shooting two passing motorists who see Showalter moving the trooper's body off the road), Showalter calls Jerry and says he wants the entire $80,000 ransom, leaving Jerry with nothing. Of course everyone knows that Jerry is in no position to negotiate, threaten or demand anything from Showalter and Grimsrud. Being inept and having poorly thought out of this kidnapping plan, Jerry doesn't have anything on the kidnappers to use for leverage, but they have everything on Jerry, as Grimsrud and Showalter know that Jerry personally met and hired them to kidnap his wife and if the police should capture them first, they can always rat on Jerry by claiming that he was the mastermind of the whole thing. Jerry knows that he has no choice but to agree to any demands the kidnappers threaten him with.7. Once again, the plan backfires on Jerry because his father-in-law knows how unreliable Jerry is and doesn't trust him with the ransom money (rightfully so) and insists on going to the exchange himself. Jerry, being spineless and afraid of his father-in-law, does not insist on going in his place or even going with him, even though he also knows that Showalter is also infuriated at Jerry and the kind of people he's dealing with. For some reason, Jerry decides to go to the meeting anyway and he finds Wade's body, which he puts in his car trunk (and possibly he knows that Wade is dead as he's entering the parking garage, given that he passes a bloodied Carl driving out). After this turn of events, Jerry goes back into work as if everything was hunky-dory until Marge goes back to interview him again. Jerry panics and flees the scene. He is eventually apprehended at a motel in North Dakota. As a final irony, Jerry, being incompetent to the end, uses the same \"Jerry Anderson\" alias that he uses when checking into the Fargo, North Dakota inn where he first meets Grimsrud and Showalter, likely another clue that enables the police to easily track him down."

      "question": "Why did Carl Showalter bury the money and not keep it for himself?",
      "answer": "Carl Showalter intended to keep the rest of the money for himself which is precisely why he buried it. The shots showing the fence on the left and right show that he did not have any type of identifying marker to find the money again. This is why he sticks the windshield ice scraper into the ground. Carl's plan was to hide the money, return with the $80,000 to split evenly, then to take the car and return to the spot where he buried it to reclaim the remaining $920,000 giving him a grand total of $960,000 and Grimsrud would have never been any the wiser."

    {
      "question": "Why did Showalter argue with Grimsrud about paying for half of the car?",
      "answer": "At the end of the film, Showalter now has $1,000,000. Of course, instead of telling Grimsrud about this, he takes out $80,000 in order to bring to Grimsrud to split with him, as Grimsrud is only expecting a cut of $40,000. As far as Grimsrud knows, Showalter is making good on their arrangement. Showalter says he's taking the car they took for the job and that Grimsrud could have his old truck and they must part ways. Grimsrud says they need to split the car by Showalter paying Grimsrud for half the car's value if he wants the car for himself. Showalter, infuriated with the notion, reminds Grimsrud that he took a bullet in the face picking up the ransom and that he's been doing all the driving between Brainerd & Minneapolis (on almost no sleep), and threatens Grimsrud by reminding him that he still has a gun. This prompts Grimsrud to run outside and kill Showalter with an axe and dispose of his body in a wood chipper, leaving him with all $80,000.Many people would wonder why would Showalter bother arguing with Grimsrud about paying him out of his cut when he's got another $920,000 buried in the snow to pick up later that Grimsrud would never know about. Basically what it comes down to is a clear and simple case of greed. Showalter doesn't want to give any more money to Grimsrud than the agreed upon amount because he feels he did all the work and took a bullet across the face for his troubles, while Grimsrud simply looked after Jerry's wife. In the end, Grimsrud couldn't even do that and decided to kill her. Further, Grimsrud wanted a bigger cut by making a case of the new car that Jerry gave them and wanted Showalter to pay for half the car's value. While Grimsrud barely speaks throughout the film, it's obvious that he's a psychopath and has no qualms about killing anyone so it's possible that he was planning on killing Showalter anyway when he arrived back at the cabin just to steal his half of the $80,000. However, Grimsrud's decision to kill Showalter might have been only a spur-of-the-moment thing because Grimsrud didn't seem intent on killing Showalter until after Showalter started threatening him.Keep in mind as well that both Grimsrud and Showalter are petty criminals, and that their status as such may be the result of them viewing the world from a perspective that differs from that of the average person, as well as an inflated sense of entitlement and tendency to attach an out-sized significance to the kind of affront that the average person would find irritating but nonetheless dismiss relatively quickly (in other words, an inability to \"keep things in perspective\"). There are multiple, even more absurd examples in the film this mindset, including in the opening scene during the discussion about whether the agreed-on meeting time in the bar had been 7:30 or 8:30, Showalter's outrage over the $4 charge to exit the airport parking lot (and apparent need to \"get even\" with the lot cashier by insulting him), and so on. Showalter also yells at Grimsrud about doing all the driving; the distance from Brainerd to Minneapolis alone is a minimum of 127 miles & two hours, making it a four hour roundtrip. Grimsrud had refused to do any of the driving, leaving Showalter to do it and be awake for at least 36 hours, which will make anyone short on temper. Grimsrud had also refused to drive from Fargo to Brainerd, which is another 140 mile drive and about two and a half hours."

      "question": "How did Grimsrud kill Jerry's wife?",
      "answer": "It's never known for certain, but it appears he either split her head open on the side of the countertop, or possibly slashed her throat and the blood seen on the counter is arterial spray. He could even have shot her in the head at point-blank range with the pistol he'd used to kill the trooper, although Showalter had the pistol at the time. Some viewers thought that Grimsrud killed her by sticking her head in the oven because the oven door was open. But the oven was turned on and the door was open simply to give off heat to try and warm up the cabin."

      "question": "What happened to the money?",
      "answer": "It's left buried in the snow with nobody knowing it was there. However in the first season of the TV series (2014–) on FX, it's revealed that some days later after the events in the feature film, a down on his luck businessman, Stavros Milos, pulled over to the side of the road in the middle of a nervous breakdown to pray to God for help. He looks towards the fence and sees the ice scraper buried in the snow. He finds the money (containing $920,000 in cash) and uses it to invest in a supermarket chain, which makes him a millionaire. He credits his finding the money as a miracle from God. Edit"
