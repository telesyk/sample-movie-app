      "title": "Don't Forgo Fargo",
      "content": "Boy, is this a good movie. In its bare bones it is a crime drama but the Coen brothers constantly undercut the seriousness with a quirky irony. The acting, the script, and the direction lift the movie light years above most of the movies of its decade.The performances, for instance, everyone speaks with what passes for an upper Midwestern accent, a very pronounced accent, let's say. So when characters are doing wicked things on screen, it's rather like watching people dressed in clown suits do nasty things. It's utterly impossible to take it very seriously -- only just seriously enough for us to feel sorry for the victims and to disapprove of the bad guys, but no more than that.Everyone except the two killers are forced by their culture to speak and act cheerfully. They never swear either. \"You're darn tootin',\" they say. The casting couldn't be better, with Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, and Bill Macy outstanding.The script is likewise splendidly done. It's full of scenes that seem peripheral except that they add to our understanding of the characters and often lead to later payoffs. Without taking the space to describe them, I will simply mention the scene in the restaurant between MacDormand and her Japanese friend from high school. Why is it in there at all? (My God, those hotel restaurants are depressingly ugly.) Well -- among other things, such as establishing the kind of milieu these folks consider Ritzy, it tells us quite a bit about how MacDormand handles attempts to violate her inherent good nature. When the Japanese guy tries to sit next to her she tells him firmly that she'd prefer it if he sat across the table so that she can see him more easily. When he breaks down in tears she whispers that it's all okay. She is polite, a little distant without being unfriendly, completely practical, and absolutely iron bound in her values. Nobody is going to take advantage of or discompose this hyper pregnant babe. Further, this scene is a set up for a later one. After MacDormand learns that the Japanese guy has told her a gaggle of lies, she wakes up to the fact that, yes, people can tell untruths -- and she returns to interview Macy a second time. In another scene, when she's pressing one of the criminals during an interview, he excuses himself for a moment and she spots him taking off in his car. She exclaims, \"Oh, for Pete's sake, he's FLEEIN' THE INTERVIEW.\" It's impossible to improve on a line like that, or on MacDormand's delivery of it.The third element of the film that makes it superior is the direction. The pauses come at the right times. A woman is sitting on her couch watching a soap opera on TV. Through the glass door of her apartment she sees a man approach. He's wearing a black ski mask and carrying a crowbar. He walks up to her door and shades his eyes while trying to peer inside. Now in an ordinary action movie, by this time the woman would be screeching and speeding down the hallway. Not here. The victim sits there staring at the intruder as he fiddles at the door, half horrified and half curious. \"Who is this guy? He's not the meter reader, is he?\" Coen the director has an eye for the suggestive picturesque too. Bill Macy has asked his father-in-law for a large loan for some sure-fire business proposition, but Dad offers him only a finder's fee. We see Macy's deflated face as his disappointment sets in. Cut. Now we're looking at a white screen punctuated by four or five bare trees equidistant from one another, and there is a tiny car in the middle of the whiteness. Then Macy's tiny figure trudges into the bottom of the shot and we realize we're looking at a snow-filled parking lot with only one ordinary-sized car in the center of it.Wintery weather plays an important part in the movie. People die in it, drive off the road because of it, stand shivering in it. Two freezing people are conversing on the street while one shovels snow. The shoveler stops, gazes up at the sky, and remarks that it \"ought to be really cold tomorrow.\" Cars and ambulances tend to drive in and out of white outs during blizzards and blowing snow. MacDormand is driving her murdering prisoner through a niveous white landscape in which nothing much is visible and she is mildly remonstrating with him, saying something like, \"Why did you do it, for a little bit of money? It's a perfect day, and here you are.\" (A perfect day!) There are seven murders in this movie. Only three take place on screen. The others either take place off screen or else the director has the good sense to cut at the moment the gun fires or the ax blade lands.\"Fargo\" is one of perhaps half a dozen movies from the 1990s that I would consider buying on DVD. It's an original and refreshingly adult picture. Don't miss it."

      "content": "I didn't see this in the theater but saw it the first week it was out for rental, and have enjoyed it ever since. In fact, I probably enjoy this more each time I view it. It's a sick movie, though, make no mistake about that. However, it holds a strange fascination, probably because of the odd characters.About the story: first, it is NOT a true story as indicated in the movie. That's a lie. It's a fictional kidnapping-turned into murder story with a few bloody scenes, lots of profanity (most of it by Steve Buscemi) and a comedy. Yup, this is pure \"black comedy.\" It's dark humor mixed in with a parody about the way the Scandanavian people in the upper Midwest supposedly speak.Both William H. Macy and Frances McDormand have some wonderful facial expressions along with their accents. Those two and Buscemi are the lead characters and all three \"are a trip.\" Macy is hilarious; the best character in here, in my opinion. The more I watch this film, the funnier he gets. It's also the best role, I assume, ever for McDormand who was never a star before - or since - this movie. Her character in here, \"Marge Gunderson,\" elevates this movie from just another modern-day sick crime movie, to an original. It's nice to see a wonderful husband-wife relationship, too, as is shown here with her and husband \"Norm\" (John Lynch).You have this clean, old-fashioned lady cop (McDormand), a middle-of-the-road bungling car salesman (Macy) and two extreme low-life killers in \"Carl Showalter\" (Buscemi) and \"Gaear Grimsrud\" (Peter Stormare) all combining to make this story a mixture not only of people but genres. Other minor characters are strange, too, led by one of Marge's old high school acquaintances \"Mike Yanagita\" (Steve Park). Add to that some equally-bizarre music (slow violins) and you have this unusual story that brings out the morbid fascination in us viewers.So, I guess what I am saying is this movie truly is an original, the best film the Coen Brothers have ever made and maybe the rest roles ever for the three main actors, McDormand, Macy and Buscemi."

      "content": "Fargo (1996) is a movie I recently watched again on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a group of kidnappers executing a paid job for a scammer of sorts. As some eccentrically behaved local detectives start investigating a recent murder conducted by the previously referenced kidnappers, the entire kidnapping may get blown up. This move is directed by the amazing Coen Brothers (Raising Arizona) and stars William H. Macy (Shameless), Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs), Kristin Rudrüd (Drop Dead Gorgeous), Frances McDormand (Nomadland) and John Carroll Lynch (Zodiac). The storyline for this is so interesting and contains intricate characters, sub plots and primary plot. There's so much depth in every aspect of this movie you get fascinated by every facet, and both the good and bad guys. Loved how the entire story unfolds and every aspect of this movie is satisfying. I'd score this a 10/10 and is an American all time masterpiece."

      "content": "With all the sorry films these days it is good to see a movie as funny, wicked, dramatic, and utterly demented as \"Fargo\". It's one of those films that you just have to see. William H. Macy gives an Oscar-nominated performance as a car salesman who hires two thugs (one a know-it-all-know-nothing and the other a demented psychopath) to kidnap his wife so that he can keep half the ransom from her well-off father. Needless to say nothing goes right and Brainerd sheriff Frances McDormand (in an Oscar-winning role) comes in to save the day. I won't give anything away because the material is too good to tell those who haven't seen this inventive film. \"Fargo\" was ranked on the 100 Greatest Films list in 1996 and it was well-deserved. In this age of by-the-numbers film making, this film was a refreshing flashback to the risk-taking style that made the 1970s such a great decade for movies. 5 stars out of 5."

      "content": "I just love McDormand's face when she says that line - she takes a beat, her facial expression doesn't change, and then it comes out of her mouth like she's ordering a hamburger. Brilliant.This is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw it the first day it opened in New York City, and I loved it. I've seen it again since. What strikes me during repeated viewings is the spareness of it. Fargo moves very quickly and there isn't anything peripheral in it, no fillers. It's just a great movie and a great story with great characterizations. Wow, when I put it that way, it sounds like anyone could do it. Would that were true.There's no point in going through the story. I'll just write that Frances McDormand is sensational, as is everyone in the film - she and William H. Macy are standouts. You can really feel his desperation.There are so many great scenes - when Marge thinks she's going to barf, the scene with Macy referenced above, her little lecture to the criminals, the stamp discussion. And who can forget her old friend from high school? That scene is priceless! I also love the endless expanse of snow when the search for the money begins.This film was a real high point for me. It is a true masterpiece done by two of our most imaginative filmmakers and starring one of our finest actresses. What can I say, except I'm heading out to the wood chipper."

      "title": "Another jewel from the Coens",
      "content": "This movie opens with the words \"This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.\" I never challenged these words, but apparently no such incidents as depicted in this film ever occurred. The movie plays out quite believably - A middle-class car salesman gets in over his head financially by embezzling from his employer, thinking that the business deals he is making with the money will allow him to replace the stolen goods before he is detected. When his schemes don't pan out he must find a way to replace the money. The salesman's father-in-law - and employer - is wealthy but distant and indifferent towards him, so he hatches a plan to fake his wife's kidnapping with the help of two felons he doesn't know at all who are \"vouched for\" by an ex-con mechanic that works at the same dealership he works for. He figures his father-in-law will pay the ransom, he'll split it with the felons, and his problems will be solved. This is not to be the case. It turns out that these felons are more violent and uncontrollable than the salesman counted on, and they leave quite a body count in their wake. Also, in another clever twist, what becomes of the ransom money over which so many greedy people in the film have fought and died is quite ironic to say the least. Although I wouldn't exactly say we read this story in the paper everyday, we all have read something similar - someone who has lived an ordinary life for several decades suddenly gets tempted into some criminal activity that quickly escalates out of control.The person who unravels the mystery of the crimes is the most unstereotypical of police officers - Marge Gunderson. She is the extremely pregnant chief of police in the small town where the first murders occur, and her combination of brains and folksy charm masterfully handle witnesses and trace the crime back to the car salesman and his dealership.I've never been to Minnesota, but if the Coens' rendition of that state and its people was as spot-on as their parody of the American southwest in \"Raising Arizona\", then they have really done their research. I highly recommend it."

      "title": "Cold-hearted",
      "content": "The Coen brothers' 'Fargo' is nearly a great film: a beautifully shot, blackly comic thriller that quietly subverts every convention of the genre. This is a film where the remote mid-western city of Minneapolis plays the same role as New York in a normal crime story, a hub of civilisation and vice; where the hero is a woman (and a heavily pregnant, happily married woman at that); and the chief villain a car salesman of absolutely no slickness whatsoever. In a final irony, most of the action doesn't even take place in Fargo, but in the even more obscure town of Brainerd. Yet I found it hard to love this film. At brief moments (in depicting the relationship of policewoman Marge, played superbly by Frances McDormaid, and her husband), it feels astonishingly tender, yet at others, it feels as if it is simply making fun of the strange folks from outer America with the wacky accents and absurdly stoical demeanour. And the combination of deadpan acting and frankly silly plot excess sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Above all else, perhaps, 'Fargo' lacks a beating heart: while nearly moving, and nearly funny, there's a part of this film that refuses to commit itself, that prefers to hold back and mock not just its subjects, but also the idea that a film should take itself seriously. The Coens are widely celebrated as among the best film-makers of our age, but watching their films, I usually end up wondering whether irony is not a slightly over-rated virtue. Fargo looks lovely, and weird, and has a wry outlook all of it's own; but it won't make you laugh out loud, or cry. If it wasn't called a masterpiece I might almost like it."

He hires two small time crocks from Fargo to kidnap his wife. The plan is for her father to pay off and for Jerry to take the money. Things don't exactly goes as planned as they kill three people and get a pregnant Chief on their tail.The Coen brothers have does a terrific job on this movie. It's a well written, original story with an original setting and it doesn't try to be anything it isn't. Just a few characters, a simple plot and small scale. They stay away of clichés and don't even remotely try to mix in anything of that regular Hollywood crap. They manage to capture the mood, the people and the action pretty good. The characters are great, they're reasonable and believable. They manage to keep it serious, but not too serious and put inn a joke here and there.The actors are great. They way they manage to put on a happy smile and make it seem polite and a little, but not all too false in a great way. William H. Macy is great as Jerry Lundegaard. He gives a little nervous, kind of boy scout performance and it fits perfect. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare makes two great small time losers. Buscemi is great as a small, funny looking, constant talking bad guy and Stormare fits the big silent, violent, psychopath type really good and they act these characters all the way out. Kristin Rudrüd does a good job as Jean Lundegaard and Harve Presnell as the rich dad is always a winner.The cinematography is good. All of the shots are good looking and some of them are original, cool and extra good looking. All of the shots are well composed, the lightning is good, but not much out of the ordinary. There are a nice play with the colors in some shots involving the snow.The score is really nice. The theme is a little sad and so is the movie. It's moody and supports the action and fits the settings very well. It's used in a classical way between the action and that works very well, it makes the action seem more real and more close.Fargo is a original movie out of the ordinary. The story is good, well written and it's well brought to life and captured. The Coen brothers has made a timeless and very enjoyable movie. See it!"

      "content": "The Coen brothers can always be guaranteed to deliver a quirky, diverting, off-key movie experience, and FARGO remains their most successful movie to date; a story of small-town life, dead cold temperatures, and a bloody crime wave. As with the majority – if not all – of their films, it's a densely-plotted, intelligently-scripted story, with a cold grasp on reality throughout but nevertheless some absurd situations to enjoy.Things begin small and gradually build up to a blood-spattered climax, propelled by tons of originality and irregularity which propels this past most similar genre fare. Frances McDormand deservedly got an Oscar for her excellent performance as the pregnant cop, but William H. Macy is equally good as the nervous car salesman whose life spirals out of control. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are also brilliant as the two psychotic criminals who begin by kidnapping and end in well I'll leave it for you to find out. In parts touching, warm, funny, frightening and shocking, FARGO is an example of the crime thriller at its best."

      "content": "\"What'd this guy look like anyway?\" \"Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'.\" \"Uh-huh. In what way?\" \"Just a general way.\" In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan Coen's finest film. Of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made, such as Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski. But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers' takes on plot, art and drama more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry Lundegaard's stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson's confrontation with Gaear and the wood-chipper. Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced, intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H. Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn't imagine an actress doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, \"He's fleeing the interview!\" Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con his father-in-law out of money. There's comic brilliance watching Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior, and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing Jean Lundegaard, Jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife. If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent life on this planet, you'll enjoy the little more than the hour and a half this movie has to show you."

Joel Coen working together with his brother, Ethan, have made pictures that will be viewed as classics, as time will tell. Their movies are always an excellent way to spend some time because they always manage to deliver, even in films that aren't popular with the public.A lot of what makes this film work is the amazing casting feat the Coen brothers achieved in giving Frances McDormand and William H. Macy, two of our best film actors, prominent presence in it. The Marge Gunderson of Ms. McDormand is one of the best creations the Coen brothers have produced. The same can be said of William H. Macy's take on the pathetic Jerry Lundergaard, the idiotic man who sets things in motion in the film. Ms. McDormand and Mr. Macy have only one scene together, yet one wouldn't even think about other actors playing these roles.The supporting cast of \"Fargo\" is a joy to watch. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make two of the most enjoyable bad guys in memory. These two scum bags are a joke. Anyone in his right mind wouldn't entrust either Carl or Gaer for a hit job. John Carroll Lynch plays Norm, the stoic man who is married to Marge. Harve Presnell is good as Wade Gustafson.The atmosphere created by the Coens work well. We are constantly reminded of the deep winter seasons of the area where the action takes place. They have given their characters a local flavor and even to hear them talk would take us to that region of the country.\"Fargo\" is a joy to watch thanks to Joel and Ethan Coen."

I think it is because the film had SO much hype....so many people saying it was brilliant that the film simply could NOT live up to all the hype. In other words, while a very good film, it certainly was hyped a LOT when it debuted and garnered a lot of attention during the Oscars. I think it also didn't help that they called it a comedy...which it really isn't.The story, despite what it says at the prologue, is NOT a true story. It's the story of a greedy idiot and some dangerous idiots who go to work for him arranging for a kidnapping of the man's wife. I'd say more....but at this point there are over 1000 reviews on IMDB.I recommend you see it. Just adjust your expectations and DON'T think it's a comedy. Yes, a few parts are darkly funny but the Coen Brothers do not appear to have been making a comedy here. I'd put it in the same sort of category as their gritty films like \"Blood Simple\". The acting is excellent, particularly Francis McDormand who won the Oscar for her performance. She played a most unusual character....one who was not funny at all...just a competent sheriff who manages to unravel a weird and most unusual...and bloody case.Overall, I strongly recommend the film...it's well done, though a few other Coen Brothers films manage to be even better."

      "content": "I hesitate to call this a comedy film. I found parts of it funny but more in the way that Wes Anderson films are dainty rather than laugh-out-loud funny. The storyline features a clueless and bumbling car salesman attempting a hare-brained scheme with equally incompetent criminals, all juxtaposed a disarmingly mundane and friendly Midwest setting. The stand-out feature of this film is the acting, as the characters are all perfect depictions of those who simply cannot get anything right! I see more inspiration from old screwball films than traditional crime dramas. After a spate of Martin Scorsese films, Heat and Scarface, the easygoing style of this film was a breath of fresh air."

      "content": "I had watched \"Fargo\" several years ago, and just last night re-watched it on DVD. I intended to see half of it, go to bed at my normal time, and see the last half this morning. But it isn't that kind of movie. It draws you in, the dialog and editing are so good, you want to keep watching. And so I did. It deserves its high rating.some SPOILERS follow, don't read further if you haven't seen \"Fargo\" yet. Bill Macy is perfect, absolutely, as \"Jerry\" the car sales manager who can't quite get his life in order. You see, Jerry basically cares only about himself. He has some unspecified debt, his father in law (Harve Presnell) is rich but has a very low, deservedly, opinion of Jerry. So Jerry does the only thing he can figure, through a paroled American Native car mechanic that works in his dealership gets hooked up with two thugs (Buscemi and Stormare) who will kidnap Jerry's wife, hold her safe, until Jerry convinces pop-in-law to pay a ransom, which he uses to pay off the thugs and erase his own debt. Ever the schemer, Jerry tells the thugs he will split $80,000 with them, but really plans to extort $1Million and just give them $40,000. In an early scene to establish character, we see Jerry scamming a customer by charging him for a \"topcoat\" treatment that he said a day earlier he would throw in free. Jerry was simply a very flawed person.Things go terribly wrong, thugs get stopped at night in the snow, Stormare shoots the cop, plus two passers by who are tracked down after witnessing the crime scene. Margie (Frances McDormand, oscar winner) is the town sheriff and gets on the trail. She calmly travels to the Twin Cities, interviews people, pieces together clues, finds the hideout near the lake, comes upon Stormare grinding up Buscemi's body, the dead hostage in the cabin. In the interim the father in law gets gunned down, as well as a parking lot attendant. This film is best classified as a very dark comedy. Margie and her fisherman husband are two of the very few normal people in this film, The others - Jerry, his family, the mechanic, the thugs, the prostitutes - are all way off center, and some of the situations and dialog are very funny, within the context of a film where a number of murders are committed. The funniest scene is during the shooting of Presnell, who wounds Buscemi on the right cheek, and he spends the rest of the film with rather large strips of paper stuck to his face to stop the bleeding, his hands and coat collar red and blood-soaked. I mean, there's really nothing funny about murder, but the Buscemi character is very funny."

      "content": "\"Films like \"Fargo\" are why I love the movies\", said Roger Ebert. The film-makers Joel and Ethan Coen, the writing/directing team also known as Two Headed Director, are the reason why I believe in the modern movie-making. To take the story like the one Fargo is based on which has been told so many times before and, I am sure, will be told over and over again, to turn and twist it in the most in-anticipated ways, to create the characters so alive and three dimensional that you believe every word they say and every step they take, to provide them with some of the best quotes and dialogs I've ever had pleasure to hear, to mix dry humor and humanity, to make the film recognizable but uniquely beautiful, dark, dramatic, and funny - that's what Coens achieved in Fargo which has been supposedly the Best film they ever made. All of Coens' fans have their own favorite film but it is hard to disagree that with Fargo, Coens sealed the place in Cinema Hall of Fame. Fargo is a movie of many dimensions. As many of Coens' films, it centers on a botched crime that includes kidnapping gone terribly wrong. Many viewers see it as a dark comical crime/mystery thriller which it is but it is much more. It rises to the high tragedy, and it is one of the most beautiful gentle love stories committed to screen which is very unusual for Coens. What I especially love in Fargo - the perfect balance between the scenes of building suspense, graphic violence, humor, and the real drama from the lives of the real people.The visual palette of the film with color white dominating the screen is stunning, and the snow that covers American Midwest for what seems the eternal winter, is as important character for the film as the rest of them. The sorrowful music score deserves a special mention for creating the mood. It has been told a lot about dream cast that Coens gathered for the film. Of all stars, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy got the most recognition, and very deservingly so. Macy is amazing and a spot- on, and in the final scene of the film, genuinely heartbreaking. It is impossible to imagine anybody else in the role of Jerry Lundegaard, the desperate man who came up with the perfect scheme to become rich without hurting anyone and whose good intentions paved the road directly to hell of Shakespearean proportions. Macy was determined from the beginning that it was HIS role in spite Coens' doubts even after the second reading. He did not hesitate to beg them, and the result proved absolutely terrific. Any way we look at Fargo, it is a great work of Cinema that would make it difficult for its creators to overpass its perfection. As a true masterpiece, it only gets better as time passes and it turns with new facets with every new viewing."

They have made some of the finest films of the last two decades; among them are: The Big Lebowski, Brother, Where Art Thou? And Blood Simple. However, Fargo is easily the best of all others the Coens have done.The cast is led by the multi-talented Frances McDormand, a winner of several awards over the years. She particularly shines in this film. She is amply supported by some talented character actors including William Macy, a hilarious Steve Buscemi, and a fearsome Peter Stormare, who plays a menacing killer. The setting of Fargo in North Dakota, is a great part of its atmosphere and charm. Don't miss this classic."

I've heard how this film is a \"black comedy\" by the Coen Brothers, who supposedly are geniuses in the film industry. And I've listened to friends discuss how creative and wonderful the film is. But none of this, I repeat, NONE OF THIS, is apparent in this movie. What I watched was a film confused at whether to be serious or comedic. And in making up its mind, both elements are fused together in a twisted fashion with an out-of-place Canadian humor.Basically the story is about a car salesman who needs cash...fast, so he pays a couple of guys to kidnap his wife so that her rich father will pay the ransom, thereby getting him the cash he needs. Well, all goes to hell as the kidnappers end up on a killing spree with a cop questioning all possible leads, including the car salesman himself.If in fact this film was based on a true story (as indicated at the beginning), I would be horrified if I were close to one of the victims. The Coen brothers make a strange mockery out of the deaths of the victims portrayed and deter the audience from taking the film seriously, instead giving them a quasi-mental hypothermia with the serious/humorous dichotomy. And even if this film is not based on a true story, it is so poorly directed that I just felt like I had wasted my time going around in circles. But yet I'll walk out my front door and everyone will still be applauding this satirical trash. Sigh. What did I miss here?!"

      "title": "An excellent film, although the comedy is so watered down and so sarcastic that it's not funny to most people.",
      "content": "When I saw this movie for the first time, a few years ago, I didn't understand it, and it annoyed me a lot. However, I've always heard good things about it, and after seeing several Cohen films that I liked, I realized the film's potential and decided to rewatch it. I did it at a good time: the film is better than I thought, and I just didn't know how to evaluate it as it deserved.The film begins with a note indicating that it is based on real events. It's a joke, actually, as it's entirely fictional. The story, however, can be based on several crimes, because it's nothing that we haven't seen on some TV news: a man who desperately needs money decides to hire two criminals and fake the kidnapping of his own wife, in order to convince his wealthy father-in-law to pay a fat ransom. It turns out that, as is so often the case in Cohen Brothers movies, things don't go as planned, the criminal duo's control gets out of hand and people start to die, as the local authorities, which practically boil down to a pregnant sheriff and a few colleagues, try to investigate what is going on.The film made a huge sensation among critics and at festivals. It was nominated for several Oscars, but only won two statuettes (Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress). It was also considered by many to be the best film by the Cohen Brothers, a highly relative consideration, which largely depends on the personal taste of the person who claims it. Anyway, it's a good movie, quite tense and dramatic, and where the comedy is in the brutally ironic way in which things happen.Frances McDormand is an actress who deserves particular attention in this film. She's not the kind of law enforcement officer we'd expect to see, because she appears to have a friendliness and sweetness that goes hand in hand with uncompromising law enforcement or even the use of firearms. However, her character does that and is actually very good at following her lead. Another actor to be congratulated is Steve Buscemi. He gives a huge performance, perhaps one of the best of his career so far. Next to him, Peter Stormare gives us the image of a cold and few-spoken criminal, who exerts brutal violence when he gets angry. William Macy is convincing in the role of the car salesman, with a slimy overdose of hypocritical politeness and cowardice.Technically, the film has excellent cinematography, where snow and gray tones are the dominant accent. Interestingly, it seems that a lot of artificial snow was used in the film in order to achieve the icy and inhospitable look that the directors wanted. The sets and costumes are very good, particularly McDormand's costume and her hairstyle. The film uses a lot of very good visual and special effects, particularly in the more violent scenes, like the one where the killer tries to tear his victim apart in a shredder. The soundtrack has one of the most interesting main themes in the Cohens' filmography."

William Macy as Jerry certainly did a good job as the auto salesman who fell on hard luck and had to have his wife kidnapped. You betcha! And that kidnapping scene where the two guys botched it was funny in a sick kinda way, considerin' they killed her and all. Yaw! Those Coen brothers. A couple of Minnesotans, ya know, can tell a pretty gory tale and make it work out. And where else would you find a wood chipper bein' a major part of a story?

      "title": "YEP! I AM THE ONE GUY WHO DIDN'T LIKE FARGO!",
      "content": "Okay, I know I have just made more enemies than I can count. But, I ask, what is so funny about Fargo? Really, I never laughed through the whole movie, ever. I have a really twisted sense of humor, but anything can make me laugh. I loved O' Brother Where Art Thou. I loved Happy Gilmore. I loved Clerks. I loved Dr. Strangelove. I loved Blazing Saddles. So there, I love a very diverse amount of comedies. But I did not love Fargo.First off, the accents. People say that these Wisconsin accents are hilarious. Well, they're not. I grew up in the South, okay. I have never met a person with a Wisconsin accent in my life. But I do see them in movies and on TV a lot. These are just normal accents. There is nothing satirical about them. They aren't that funny. Get over it.Okay, the plot. Is it just me or is the plot to this movie mediocre and boring? It's an average crime movie. I know crime movies. That's my forte, you could say. My favorite movie genre is crime (Pulp fiction, Leon, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, Heat, etc...). But this movie is just an average movie. The plot is pretty predictable too. I could have guessed the entire movie from the word go.Now, I will give credit where credit is due. The movie isn't all bad. The acting is good. The dialog is quick and edgy. The writing is intelligent. And the direction is sharp and nice. But there is nothing funny, groundbreaking, or remotely interesting about this movie.Okay, one last gripe. If you haven't seen the movie, avert thy eyes, because the ending is about to be told. Okay, you still here? Good, I warned you.The wood chipper scene is one of the most famous scenes in the history of movies, or so it has become. Honestly, I see nothing funny about it. It's not that I'm against throwing people into wood chippers. I liked Evil Dead 2. Gore doesn't bother me. But what is so damn funny about throwing a human corpse into a wood chipper? It makes sense to me. If you wanted to dispose of a body and a wood chipper is near by, well hey! IDEA! THROW IT IN! But is it funny? Not really. Is it gory? No. Is it bad? No. But is it deserving of being called one of the greatest scenes ever? HELL NO!I am really trying to understand people's love of this movie. I wasn't the biggest fan of The Blues Brothers, but I understand why people love it. Fargo isn't funny, nor is it very interesting. The acting is the only thing that kept me interested. I love W.H. Macy. All the actors and actresses are good in this movie. But is this movie the work of genus that people make it out to be? No, ohhhhhhhhhh God no. In conclusion: This movie is an \"okay\" movie. There's nothing bad about it, but it isn't great. I hate it when people make movies out to be better than they really are. I found The Untouchables, The Blues Brothers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Being John Malkovic, and Fargo to all be overrated movies. They're not bad, they're just not great, or even that good either. (ESPECIALLY CROUCHING TIGER!) People, please join me in the crusade to bring the truth out and bring down the overrated movies!My rating: 5/10PS: Go ahead, send the hate mail. I welcome it."

      "title": "Reflections on a second viewing",
      "content": "This should stand as the Coen brothers' tour de force, although I found \"The Big Lebowski\" to be an even more satisfying film. I look at \"Fargo\", \"The Big Lebowski\", and \"Brother, Where Art Thou?\" as being the Coen's three best movies. I hope there is more from them in the future that can rival these three; though recent offerings such as \"Intolerable Cruelty\" and \"The Ladykillers\", could be proving their peak creativity is behind them. \"Fargo\" is beyond a doubt, their masterpiece. IMDb's ratings bear this out - 8.2 for \"Fargo\", 8.0 for \"Lebowski\", and 7.8 for \"Brother\". For sheer entertainment, \"Lebowski\" or should I call it, \"The Dude\" wins handsdown, but \"Fargo\" has all the elements of a true classic. Beyond a doubt, I have never seen such a dramatically-obvious portrayal of good vs. evil, and never, never, have I seen such gut-wrenching violence. Oh, the violence, beautifully believable, in it's grotesque way. This movie is proof that artistic freedom to portray such violence should never be denied. Steve Buscemi's bullet-grazed face becomes almost as painful for the watcher as it is for his character; Steve Buscemi's leg in the wood chipper is as horrific a scene as you are ever going to see. Enough to give Marge Gunderson morning sickness all over again. And the good vs evil thing: so obvious in the contrasts between Marge (the good), Buscemi and Stormare (the evil), and poor Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) squeamishly caught in a trap in-between. I could only handle the violence because of Marge. She is the rock of normality, who continues trumpeting the virtuous life, when all hell is breaking loose around her. She knows all-to-well that \"you know what\" happens, but always knows \"you know what\" can be flushed down the toilet. Frances McDormand, as Marge, deserves every acting award she ever got for this role. Marge, to me, is the most perfect cop I've ever encountered. She is polite, non-judgemental, yet able to ask the tough questions that gets her the information she needs. You can see how thoroughly she sizes up those she interviews: watching every nuance of their body language, and hearing ever inflection of their speech. Now here's a woman who can spot a lie when others can't. Unlike so many cops in movies, she doesn't have to beat information out of someone; she can charm it out of them, all the while appealing to their moral responsibility, no matter how immoral they may be.This is so well-shown in scenes such as talking to the two young hookers in the bar, and putting Jerry on the hotseat in the car dealership interrogations. I elected not to watch some of the scenes on my second viewing. Somewhat oddly, I skipped almost all the scenes involving Jean Lundegaard (the kidnapped one) - I couldn't bear to watch what was happening to this woman, knowing full well her fate. I felt so sorry for her; she was the true victim in this - the most innocent, yet the one who suffered the most. I guess a case could also be made that her son, Scotty, suffered equally, but most of what he went through was not presented on camera. Maybe he would suffer the most, for he had to live afterward. Even Marge would suffer from this catastrophe, but you know her suffering will be tempered by an unwavering belief that good triumphs over evil. As the last scene shows (Marge getting into bed with her husband): despite the horrors that might go on around us, we must seek solace in the everyday beauty of the things that are nearest and dearest to us all. And this message is conveyed to us all by the Coen brothers without any allusions to religion whatsoever. But I'm getting into a personal bias of my own here - if you take solace in religion playing a part in morality, so be it."

Having heard for years about FARGO since they made also a TV show based on it, I knew that some day I would have seen it, and I did last March. Considering that to date there are 1,087 reviews I'll be short.Jerry Lundergaard (William Macy) is an idiot businessman that has some problems in money. For having more money he has a plan: to fake the kidnapping of his wife Jean so that his father in law is forced to pay the ransom. After the advice of a car repairman he goes to a bar in Fargo where he meets Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsud (Peter Stormare) and promises them to give a car and, give half of the ransom money to both of them. Carl and Gaear succedd but Jerry didn't considered that the two are idiots: while Carl drives the car with the hostage Gaear shoots a police officer and two that were witnesses to the scene. All goes unnoticed until Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) comes, and she takes the problem personally while she is also waiting a baby. There are lots of twists and turns, but it's best that you see them for yourselves.I liked the performances: William Macy is perfect for the role of the salesman that plots the kidnapping of his wife, and Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are great as his bumbling henchmen. And while Frances McDormand looks like a supporting character, she truly deserved her Academy Award for best Actress (see the ending and you'll understand what I mean). The setting was cool in a way, and the whole movie has some sort of nostalgic feeling from the 1990s that even folks who didn't lived there like me would have.In substance, FARGO stands to his reputation as a cult movie and it's certainly a must see. Just don't have too much expectations for it."

Indeed, the plot is similar to Hamlet's, in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed. Many people seem to like Fargo for its humorous qualities, its characterization of the Minnesotan culture and Frances McDormand- not me. I love Fargo for its brilliant writing, its tragic musical score, its tragic plot, William H Macy, Harve Presnell and Steve Buscemi, its ignorance of political correctness (how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps).I want to draw attention to an overlooked reason why the film works so well - how well the music suits the visuals in this movie. Each murder scene is scored superbly, and other audio clues really add to the effect (for instance, notice how when the police officer asks Carl Showalter \"What's this?\" in reference to the abductee, a disquieting guitar sound is immediately played that has an instantaneous psychological effect on how you interpret the scene). I have seen this film over, well, an embarrassing number of times and have committed its screenplay, from start to finish, by memory. Fargo is the ultimate Coen Brothers movie, a brilliant tragedy, and restores my faith in Roger Ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the '90s."
