      "question": "Is 'Monsters, Inc.' based on a book?",
      "answer": "Monsters, Inc. is a computer-animated comedy film written by Jack W. Bunting, Jill Culton, Peter Docter, Ralph Eggleston, Dan Gerson, Jeff Pidgeon, Rhett Reese, Jonathan Roberts, and Andrew Stanton. It's said that the original idea for the screenplay was based on the childhood experiences of one of the Pixar crew, who had a bunch of toy monster figurines as a child. The original screenplay was about a man who is an advertising designer and leads a very boring life. He is afraid to take risks and feels that his career is at a dead end. When his mother cleans out the attic and sends him his box of toy monsters, who were also his childhood Imaginary friends, the monsters—Mike, Sulley and Randall—once again become his imaginary friends and inspire him to regain the creativity and sense of adventure he had as a boy. Obviously, the original idea went through a lot of revisions before it became the movie on the screen."

      "answer": "To collect their screams, which are needed by Monsters, Inc., the utility company that provides energy to Monstropolis City. It's becoming more and more difficult nowadays to enter children's bedrooms through their closets, scare them while they sleep, and collect their screams, what with all the movies, television programs, and videogames that depict large amounts of violence, desensitizing the children (as is discussed in a Monsters Incorporated commercial in the movie)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why are the monsters so afraid of human children?",
      "answer": "They've been told by Mr Waternoose that children are poisonous. Just touching one can be lethal to a monster. To even return with so much as a child's sock hanging from their fur results in elaborate decontamination by the CDA (Child Detection Agency)."

    {
      "question": "Why are Sulley and Randall considered to be rivals?",

      "question": "Is there anything after the final credits?",
      "answer": "As the final credits roll, they show \"outtakes\" that are like movie bloopers, only they feature the monsters. One outtake that is especially catching is the company play that Mike told everyone he and Sulley were rehearsing."

      "question": "Who was Roz really?",
      "answer": "During most of the film, Roz was just the daunting secretary who kept hassling Mike for not turning in his reports. At the end of the movie, Roz reveals that she is really an undercover agent for the CDA. Apparently, they suspected that something was going on in the factory that might involve bringing human children into the Monster World, against the law, but were unable to get any solid information. When Sulley found a human child in the factory, and Mike tricked Waternoose into exposing himself, that provided proof of the scheme."
    },
    {
      "question": "What caused Mr. Waternoose's villainy?",
      "answer": "He was afraid of losing Monsters, Inc., his family business, to the growing indifference of children to fright, and became desperate and unscrupulous."
