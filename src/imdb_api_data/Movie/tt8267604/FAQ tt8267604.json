      "question": "What were the family doing with the tablets?",
      "answer": "Using forged prescriptions to buy Tramadol, an opioid painkiller, widely used recreationally in Lebanon. The tablets are crushed into a powder which is then washed into the clothes.They then give the clothes to family members in prison (which is allowed by the authorities); then, their family members rinse the clothes in water and the tramadol is dissolved. They can then sell the water to fellow prisoners as \"tramadol shots\". Much of the drug is of course wasted in the process, but enough remains that the family can make a profit."
