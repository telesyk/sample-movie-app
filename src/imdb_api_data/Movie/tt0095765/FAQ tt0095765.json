      "question": "How was this film eligible to be nominated at the 62nd Academy Awards, held in March 1990, when it had apparently only opened in the USA that February?",
      "answer": "Normally a film has to be screened in LA during the previous year to be eligible, but this rule does not apply to foreign language films, which are submitted by their respective countries."

      "question": "What is it that Toto's mother should never tell Toto?",
      "answer": "If you only see the shorter version of the movie, this comment by Alfredo's wife wouldn't make any sense, but it is answered in the extended version. Alfredo was responsible for Toto and Elena not hooking up. Alfredo worked behind the scenes to make sure they never met again. Apparently Toto's mother knew about it but Toto did not. Alfredo told Toto's mother that Toto should never know that Elena really did want to meet him. Alfredo wanted Toto to think that she dumped him so he would pursue his movie vocation and not be distracted by her. In another sense it actually does make sense when viewed within the context of the original story. It could be interpreted to mean that Alfredo did not want Toto's mother to tell him when he died. This would be in keeping with Alfredo's wish that Toto never return to Giancaldo, not even for his funeral."

      "question": "Why didn't Elena show up to meet Toto at the Paradiso at 5 PM?",
      "answer": "This is another scene that was cut from the movie but is explained in the director's cut. Elena did come; just too late. Toto had just left when she arrived."
