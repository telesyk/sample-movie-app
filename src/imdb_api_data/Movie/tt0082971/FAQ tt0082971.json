      "question": "What are all these German soldiers doing in British controlled Egypt prior to World War II.? Appeasement aside, the British might be a little worried about a large group of armed Germans being in a League of Nations mandated British Protectorate.",
      "answer": "Egypt was declared an independent nation in 1922 and largely remained neutral. True, the British had a military base in Cairo to protect the Suez Canal as a result of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. But that wasn't ratified until December of that year. The film probably takes place before that."

      "question": "Did Belloq actually eat the fly that landed in his mouth towards the end?",
      "answer": "No he did not. Steven Spielberg just removed the frame where the fly flew away to make it look like Belloq ate the fly, because he thought it would be funny."

      "question": "What kind of hat does Indiana Jones wear?",
      "answer": "Dr. Jones wears a brown rabbit-felt fedora made by the Herbert Johnson Hat Company of Saville Row, London (not Stetson, as is widely reported). The hat style, known as the \"Poet,\" has a wider brim (2.75\" front and back) than many fedoras, with a 1.5\" ribbon."

      "question": "What is 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' about?",
      "answer": "In 1936, the US military learns that the Nazis have discovered Tanis, an ancient Egyptian city buried in a gigantic sandstorm in 980 B.C. Tanis is believed to be the final resting place of the Ark of the Covenant, a mystical chest built by ancient Hebrews which is said to hold the stone tablets on which the Ten Commandments were written. According to legend, any army that carries the Ark will be invincible. The US Army commissions archeology professor Dr Henry \"Indiana\" Jones () to obtain the Ark before the Nazis do. Unfortunately, the Nazis have enlisted Indy's longtime rival, French archeologist René Belloq (Paul Freeman), to also look for the Ark. However, before Indy can begin his search, he must stop in Nepal to meet with his former mentor Abner Ravenwood in order to obtain the headpiece to the Staff of Ra, an artefact which will allow him to determine the exact location of the Ark. When he gets there, he learns the artefact is now in the safekeeping of Abner's daughter Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), who holds a grudge against Indy following their failed romantic relationship years earlier.

      "question": "Is 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' based on a book?",
      "answer": "Raiders of the Lost Ark is based on a story created by film makers George Lucas (who co-produced the movie) and Philip Kaufman. The subsequent screenplay was written by Lawrence Kasdan and a novelization of the screenplay was written by Campbell Black. The film supposedly originated from Lucas' desire to create a modern version of the movie serials of the 1930s and 1940s, adventure stories that he enjoyed as a kid. Hence, this Indiana Jones film is set in 1936. It was followed by (released in 1984), Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) (1989), and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) (2008). A prequel television series, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles (1992), was produced in the early 1990s. A fifth film, the as-yet Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023), has been announced but is not yet in production. Edit"

      "question": "What is the golden head at the beginning?",
      "answer": "It is the Chachapoyan Fertility Idol, a sacred object that the Hovitos protect."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wouldn't the gold idol have been too heavy to carry?",
      "answer": "The idol appears to be about 5,000 c.c. (300 cubic inches) in volume. If it were solid gold, it would weigh around 100 kg (3,200 troy oz. or 220 lbs). The film, however, never specifies its make-up; it might well have been gold-plated stone or ceramic, seeing as Indy lifts it quite easily and Belloq lifts it easily over his head. The gold nature of the idol may not have been as important as its symbolic importance to the Hovitos."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was Tanis a real city?",
      "answer": "Yes. Tanis was at one point the northern capital of Egypt, and in 1939, after extensive excavations, a great deal of treasure and artifacts were found there (however, the Ark was not among them). See here for more details."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would Hitler, a notorious anti-Semite, want a Jewish artifact like the Ark?",
      "answer": "Marcus provides the answer in the scene where he and Indy talk to the two agents from Army Intelligence: \"An army which carries the Ark before it is invincible.\" Also, one of the agents tells them that Hitler had become obsessed with the occult. This may or may not be historically accurate, however, it was actually Heinrich Himmler (Reichsführer-SS, head of the Schutzstaffel, SS), an alleged Thule Society member and who had a fond interest in the occult."
    },
    {
      "question": "Could the map room procedure have actually shown where the Ark was located?",
      "answer": "No. There were far too many variables in play for the procedure to actually work. First of all, the staff and crystal medallion would have had to been at the correct height. Ancient peoples did not have precise measuring equipment, which is why a foot is the length of a foot and a cubit the length of a forearm. The length of Indy's staff would therefore not be the exact length needed. Secondly, the relationship between the sun and the horizon changes from day to day. Every day the sun rises further north or south from the previous day depending on the time of the year. If by chance he did have the staff at the correct height he would still have to hope it was the right time of the year. But there is one further problem: in the thousands of years since the map room was created the Earth has shifted on its axis (one of the reasons the Earth periodically has Ice Ages). Sailing ships in the past could often navigate at night because the Earth's axis pointed toward the North Star. At the time the map room was built the Earth's axis did not point at the North Star. Thus, there is no reason to think it would have worked. It's purely movie magic and myth and does make for one of the more memorable and exciting moments in the movie."

      "question": "There appears to be a shiny coating on Belloq's forehead during the desert scenes. What is it?",
      "answer": "It's a clear plastic shield, like safety glasses, for his eyes. In the desert there's a lot of wind and blowing sand so Belloq was using this device as eye protection."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why didn't anyone find the Well of Souls through the loose stone?",
      "answer": "The entire Nazi research team lead by Belloq were searching for the Ark. They wouldn't have bothered excavating just anywhere in the ancient city. This would have been extremely expensive and time-consuming (it is mentioned that Hitler's patience for the project was wearing thin as it was). They were digging specifically in the location where they believed the Ark to be, which was incorrect. Indy and Sallah were digging in the correct place, which was near the outskirts of the ancient city. It's likely that the Nazis knew the ancient ruin with the loose stones was there, but didn't bother to demolish it to look inside, either to preserve as much of the ancient ruins as possible or they simply planned to check later."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was there really a long fight scene planned between Indy and the swordsman?",
      "answer": "Yes. Footage from \"Great Movie Stunts: Raiders of the Lost Ark\" shows Harrison Ford and stuntman Terry Richards rehearsing some slashing and ducking moves. But Harrison Ford suffered from dysentery in the Tunisia location (as did many of the Raiders crew), and reportedly asked director Spielberg, \"Can't I just shoot him?\" Spielberg thought about it, said, \"Yeah, why not? Let's shoot it.\", and a classic movie moment was born."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "Although tethered to a pole, Indy and Marion are allowed to watch as Belloq opens the Ark, cameras rolling to record the momentous event. In it, they find only sand. Suddenly, lights begin flashing and bulbs exploding. Fog begins pouring out of the Ark and jets of light shoot upwards. Indy warns Marion to shut her eyes and not look at it, no matter what. The rays of light turn into ethereal beings then into skeletons. Beams of fire course through the bodies of the soldiers, consuming everyone but Indy and Marion. The fire courses upward into the skies, taking the Ark's lid with it and then depositing it back upon the Ark. When it's all over, Indy and Marion open their eyes and realize that they haven't been harmed. Weeks later, Indy and colleague Dr Marcus Brody () are in Washington being thanked (and paid) by the Army officers. Brody asks where the Ark is now, but the only answer he's given is that it's being researched by \"top men\". Leaving the office, Indy is met by Marion, who loops her arm through his and offers to buy him a drink. In the final scene, a workman is shown locking a box marked \"Top Secret...Army Intel...Do not open\" and storing it in a massive warehouse stocked with thousands of other such boxes. Edit"

      "question": "Even if Indy survived the U-boat (submarine) ride all the way to the island by clinging to the periscope, how did he get off the boat without being seen and then hide? The boat would have been in full view of the Germans during the entire docking.",
      "answer": "As the sub was approaching the island, Indy could have easily determined that there was a dock hidden there -- we see the cavern's entrance through the periscope -- and simply jumped off the sub and swam to shore. From there, he could have swam at least some of the way underwater and into the cavern. This is likely as we see Indy's still wet when he steals the German soldier's uniform."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Indy and Marion's relationship appear tumultuous when they meet?",
      "answer": "The most likely explanation for the initially extraordinarily tense relationship with the emotionally turbulent Marion Ravenhood is that Marion had romantic or even sexual relations with Indy when she was a young adolescent. Indy was born in 1899. Which would make him 36-37 during the film. Marion Ravenwood was born in 1909. Making her 26-27. Marion says \"I've learned to hate you in the last 10 years. So Indy would have been in his mid-20s and she around 16 or 17 when they first met and fell in love. The implication is that she felt taken advantage of by the older, more experienced man, an inappropriate relationship which also caused Indy's falling out with her father Abner, Indy's friend and mentor."

    {
      "question": "Where does Belloq get his \"copy\" of the Staff of Ra headpiece?",
      "answer": "Toht picked up the original during the fight in Marion's bar. Because it was extremely hot from being in the fire, the markings of one side of the headpiece was burned into his hand, which Belloq was able to copy. It proved to be worthless, however, because the markings on the other side of the original gave further instructions.There's also the explanation that since Toht was an evil Gestapo agent that the medallion burned him because of his nature. The medallion wasn't really in contact with any fire, only some burning straw on the floor."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did Belloq also use the wrong hole for his staff?",
      "answer": "You can see in the map room that the building marked for where the Nazi's are digging is directly in line with the one Indy sees illuminated, which suggests that Belloq used the correct hole, only his staff was too long. In the screenplay it states, Out in the miniature city, one small building is being lit by a tiny beam of sunlight in the center of the shadow of the metal sun. And by some trick of ancient artistry, this one building responds to the sunlight like none of the others. The golden light permeates it: it seems to glow. The building is in direct line with Belloq's -- all the Frenchman's other calculations were right -- but it is a foot and a half beyond it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why didn't Indy free Marion when he found her alive? He had a perfect chance for them both to slip away.",
      "answer": "Because he knew where the Ark was but had not found it yet. The location of the Ark he'd gotten from the previous scene showed that it was still pretty close to the main excavation. They could dig for it there, fairly well hidden from the Nazis and Belloq, but it was still close enough that they could be discovered -- which is exactly what happens when Belloq spots them later.If Marion disappeared suddenly, Belloq and the Nazi officers would do just what Indy said; they'd comb the place until she was found. An extensive search of the entire site would lead them to Jones, Sallah, and their dig, so Indy leaves her bound and gagged, much to Marion's fury, and promises to return for her when they'd find the Ark and have it safely away from the Nazis."
    },
    {
      "question": "How was Marion able to stay sober during her meeting with Belloq?",
      "answer": "Both Marion and Belloq were trying to fool each other into thinking the other was drunk. Both are hardy drinkers, as we see with Marion winning the shot contest in her bar early in the movie against a man much larger than herself. Belloq was also a hardy drinker, having grown up drinking the wine he provided, which was, in his cheerful words, \"my family label.\" Wine is much less potent than the whiskey Marion was drinking earlier, and she was able to stay sober. Assuming that Belloq was going to be inebriated faster than she was, she could escape easier. However, her assumption was wrong, and Belloq was just as sober as she was-and Toht arrived just at the moment she tried to walk out."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did Indy survive when the Nazi submarine submerged?",
      "answer": "There is a deleted scene in which you see Indy holding on to the periscope, which is sticking out of the water. Early submarines generally traveled the oceans on the surface of the water under diesel power, which requires access to the air for inlets to the engines. They could only travel short distances under water, as this required electric propulsion and the battery power of the submarine did not last very long. German U-boats would only submerge when they'd attack surface ships. However, there would generally be four or five crewman on the conning tower as lookouts. U-boats generally would submerge to a depth of roughly 12 meters, deep enough to observe the surface through the periscope. In the novelization, Indy lashed himself to the periscope with his bullwhip and rode/dozed through 20 frigid hours in oceanic water. In the movie, we never see the sub fully submerge, so are left with the conclusion that Indy rode on the top, a more believable scenario than riding it underwater without freezing or drowning."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did Indy know not to look into the Ark when it was opened?",
      "answer": "A deleted scene was shot where Imam, the wise man translating the markings on the headpiece of the Staff of Ra also translates another set of markings, which gives a warning about not looking into the Ark. Since this scene is not in the movie, it is a little confusing as to how Indy knew that he could only survive the opening of the Ark by closing his eyes. Perhaps he simply remembered the picture of the Ark he showed to the army officers; in it, an entire army is decimated, but the people carrying the Ark remain unaffected. So he may have concluded that opening the Ark is not necessarily deadly to anyone in close proximity, and that it is the visual contact that was deadly. Another option is that he remembered a relevant passage from the Bible (1 Samuel 6:19), where God \"smote\" the men of Beth Shemesh for looking into the Ark. Plus, there's a brief moment when Marcus Brody says the light from the Ark could lay waste to everything it touched, further warning of the Ark's power."
