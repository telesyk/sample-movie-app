      "question": "Why is the favela called \"City of God\"? It seems like just the opposite.",
      "answer": "\"Cidade de Deus\" (City of God) is the name of a housing project created by the government in the 1960s, where the action takes place. As usual with such projects, it was virtually abandoned by the authorities after its creation, becoming one of Rio's worst favelas (slums). This is why the name is ironic."

    {
      "question": "The \"Runts\" frequently mention the formation of a \"Red\" gang. Is there any significance to this?",
      "answer": "It's a reference to the Comando Vermelho (Red Command), a Brazilian crime syndicate which has operated in Rio de Janeiro since 1979."
