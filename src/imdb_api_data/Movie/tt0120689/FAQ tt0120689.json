      "question": "In the book, Wild Bill was only 19 years old, why does he look older in the movie?",
      "answer": "Sam Rockwell was 31 at the time of the film's release and the age of the character was largely irrelevant."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the scene where Percy scares Del for a joke, and Del trips over Brutal's foot, why doesn't Brutal apologize to Del instead of blaming Percy completely for it?",
      "answer": "Percy caused it, Brutal didn't trip Del on purpose. Therefore Percy is to blame."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it true that Mr. Jingles was actually a rat?",
      "answer": "No. He was a genuine mouse."

    {
      "question": "What is 'The Green Mile' about?",
      "answer": "Retired prison guard Paul Edgecomb () relates to fellow retirement home resident Elaine Connelly () the story of John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a man accused of murdering two young girls. However, there's more to the kind-hearted Coffey than can be seen. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is \"The Green Mile\" based on a book?",

      "question": "For what crimes were Arlen Bitterbuck and Eduard \"Del\" Delacroix sentenced to death?",
      "answer": "It is not explained in the movie. In the novel, Bitterbuck () is sentenced to death after killing a man in an argument over a pair of boots. Del (Michael Jeter) is a convicted arsonist, rapist and murderer. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why were there people sitting in the room when the executions in the film happened?",
      "answer": "Whenever a sentence of capital punishment is carried out in the United States, the law requires people be present as witnesses to see the convict actually die. The witnesses are all volunteers. In most states, if not all, the victim's family is also given the option to attend the execution, as is the case in this movie."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "Paul finishes telling his story about John Coffey to Elaine, but she doesn't seem convinced, so he takes her on a walk out to the abandoned cabin where she is introduced to a mouse sleeping in a Marsh Wheeling cigar box. It is Mr Jingles, whom Paul found after John's execution and whom he has been taking care of over since. Paul feels that John \"infected\" him and Mr Jingles with his gift of life, admitting that he is 108 years old, and that he believes this is his punishment for letting a miracle of God die in the electric chair. Following a vignette of Paul attending Elaine's funeral, Paul says in a voiceover: 'We each owe a death...there are no exceptions. But oh God, sometimes The Green Mile seems so long.\""

      "question": "Percy was going to switch jobs by going to work at the mental hospital, so why couldn't John Coffey just punish Wild Bill since he was more evil than Percy?",
      "answer": "Percy may not have been evil, but he was a cruel and sadistic bully. He certainly deserved to be punished for his actions. Including deliberately sabotaging Del's execution. Which lead to Del dying in excruciating agony. Wild Bill was a child molester and murderer who had no remorse over his actions and in fact enjoyed every second of it.John Coffey had to touch someone in order to transfer the \"sickness\" to and from a person. There's no way John was going to be able to get to Wild Bill. So he grabbed Percy, transferred the sickness to him. Percy then guns down Wild Bill and is in turn sent to the very mental institution he was supposed to transfer to. John felt that Wild Bill deserved to die. Percy deserved punishment, but not death. So Percy was put in a position where he could never hurt anyone again."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was Brutal so mad about Percy not soaking the sponge for Del's execution when Del was a murderer who was going to die anyway?",
      "answer": "Because despite Del being a condemned man, Brutal, Paul and all the men under their command believed in respecting life. Despite Del's crimes, he was remorseful. Del was somewhat simple-minded and he was polite, respectful and compliant with the guards. Percy joined the mile because he wanted to bully and torment some condemned men in order to make himself feel superior. Brutal and Paul believed that a condemned man should not be made to suffer. Which is exactly what Percy did by deliberately not soaking the sponge."

      "question": "What is the song that plays when John Coffey is healing paul?",
      "answer": "\"Red over green\" by Thomas Newman."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the wet sponge placed under the electrocution cap?",
      "answer": "Water, particularly salt water, is a good conductor of electricity. Having the brine-soaked sponge causes the electricity to move in a more efficient line, thus killing the prisoner faster (in the film, this is described as a \"bullet straight to the brain\"). Without the sponge, the electricity would simply disperse over the body, meeting with a lot of resistance, causing the body to cook, and death would be much more agonizing, as seen during Del's execution."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why didn't Paul simply stop the execution when he discovered the sponge was dry during Del's execution? There seemed to be enough time to stop it...",
      "answer": "The easiest answer that we see in the film is that there wasn't time. When Paul figures things out, Percy () has given the order, Jack (Bill McKinney) has already thrown the switch, and it's much too late to stop things and rewire Del so that he'd suffer much less. The scene is depicted in real time, but doesn't actually happen that way. There are two things going on at once: (1) Percy's management of the entire execution and his orders being followed (\"Roll on two!\" the order to throw the switch), and (2) Paul's reaction to the revelation about the sponge, the consequences that will inevitably result, and the reaction of the witnesses gathered in the room. It's all done very well to give the viewer a sense of the sequence of events involved, however, it's not actually \"real time\" as we know it. So, by the time we see everyone's actions and Paul's reaction, it's too late.When the current is on, Paul could have theoretically ordered to stop the electricity, and soak the sponge before resuming. Given the benefit of hindsight, that would certainly have been the best option. However, it probably would have looked extremely bad if Paul had interrupted the procedure, making it seem like he and the other guards can't conduct a proper execution. It's also safe to assume that nobody has witnessed an execution where the sponge was dry, so nobody had any realistic idea of how long Del's suffering would continue. Paul may have thought that Del wouldn't have lasted much longer anyway, or at the very least would pass out from the shock pretty quickly. Interrupting the execution could have unnecessarily prolonged his suffering. However, to the guards' horror, there almost seems to be no end to Del's protracted ordeal. Needless to say: had the guards known that Del would have to suffer such an extended agony, they would undoubtedly have interrupted the procedure. Unfortunately, they didn't. Edit"

    {
      "question": "What did John Coffey shoot out of his mouth everytime he healed someone?",
      "answer": "This is not fully explained in either the movie or the novel. When Coffey tried to revive the little girls, he mentioned that he tried to \"take it back\", suggesting that sickness and death are phenomena that can invade a person, but can also be taken out again. Think of it as the physical manifestation of whatever disease or sickness John \"sucked\" out of those he helped. In the short story The Little Sisters of Eluria, King describes \"Doctor Bugs\", which are parasitic organisms that first heal people so that they might feed on them slowly. It's been tossed around that Coffey's \"bugs\" may or may not be the same kind of organism, though there's no confirmation one way or the other or even that they are bugs."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why wasn't Wild Bill a suspect in the murder of the little girls?",
      "answer": "At the time of their murder, there was no link between the girls and Wild Bill Wharton (). He was simply a drifter who worked for food and a place to sleep, and he had moved on by the time the girls went missing. When they were found in the arms of John Coffey, a poor, simple-minded, imposing black man who was saying, \"I tried to take it back, but it was too late,\" that was proof enough to everyone that Coffey was guilty. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Once Paul learned the truth that Wild Bill killed the girls, why didn't he try to file an appeal for John Coffey?",
      "answer": "Paul had no physical evidence to prove that John was innocent. Just saying that John showed him what really happened through a psychic link wouldn't exactly go over well. John's knowledge of the details would have only convinced a jury that John indeed had committed the crime. Then, Percy shooting and killing Wild Bill ruined any chance of him ever admitting to the crime. On a less pragmatic note: John Coffey himself admits that, prisoner or no, his life is one of constant pain and suffering, as a result of his sensitivity to the evil in the world. To quote him directly: I'm tired boss. [...] Mostly I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. [...] It's like pieces of glass in my head all the time. After hearing this, Paul came to the conclusion that sending John Coffey to the chair could justifiably be considered an act of kindness."

    {
      "question": "How could an obviously sadistic person like Percy work in such a delicate job as a death row guard?",
      "answer": "Percy is the nephew of the Governor of Louisiana's wife, so he had political connections. If Percy felt that he was being mistreated, he'd simply call his mother or the Governor himself and complain like a spoiled child -- which he does, early in the film when he petulantly breaks Del's fingers and Paul orders him off the Mile. The other argument is that it's a different time period. In the 1930s it was much easier for an inhumane person like Percy to work at such a job. The laws hadn't been changed to, say, profile a person like Percy for his mental illness. In modern times, a condition like Percy's would've been discovered either through psychoanalysis when he applied for the job or because he'd caused a tragedy to happen. In the time the film was set, it wouldn't matter if Percy had been abusive toward a prisoner like Del, people would think Del was getting his just desserts for his crimes. The sabotage of Del's execution is something that might not have gone unnoticed by the proper authorities, however, Paul, Brutal, Dean, Harry and Warden Moores are able to cover it up since their jobs are at stake as much as Percy's would be. Percy, however, might have come out clean because of his connections to the governor's office."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Mr Jingles live as long as Paul Edgecomb?",
      "answer": "Because of the accidental \"gift\" John Coffey transferred to the mouse while holding the mouse during Del's execution. John says later that the mouse felt what he felt. When Paul takes John's hand and sees what John saw of the murders, John gives him the same gift, although this time purposefully. However, there is no indication that Mr Jingles will live \"as long as\" Paul Edgecomb, only that they both will have extended lifespans. Coffey's healing of Paul and Mr Jingles was as much a curse as it was a gift: the price that Paul pays is that he'll outlive everyone he loves, such as his wife, his son, and Elaine."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long will Paul live?",
      "answer": "As old Paul says at the end, \"We each owe a death, there are no exceptions. But oh God, sometimes the Green Mile seems so long\". His concern seems somewhat justified: by the end of the movie, Mr Jingles is at least 64 years old, about sixteen times the lifespan of a normal mouse; if the same logic applies to Paul, that would mean he could theoretically reach an age somewhere between 1300 and 1500 years, though it's ambiguous as to whether he is still able to die from external causes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Other than those who were executed at Cold Mountain Penitentiary, what happened to the other major characters?",
      "answer": "Paul Edgecomb is 108 years old and still alive. His wife Janice was killed in a bus accident in Alabama in 1956. Melinda \"Melly\" eventually died of a heart attack in 1943, and her husband, Warden Hal Moores, died of a stroke in 1941. Brutus \"Brutal\" Howell died of a heart attack while eating a fish sandwich, Harry Terwilliger died in 1982 of intestinal cancer, and Dean Stanton was stabbed in the neck by a prisoner four months after John Coffey was executed. William \"Wild Bill\" Wharton was shot by Percy Wetmore in 1932, and Percy went catatonic and lived in mental institutions until his death in 1965. Mr Jingles died of old age in 1996."
