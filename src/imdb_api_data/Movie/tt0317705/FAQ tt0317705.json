      "question": "Is \"The Incredibles\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "The Incredibles is based on a script by Brad Bird, who also directed the movie. Bird originally developed it for Warner Bros but, after Warner shut down its animation division, Bird moved to Pixar Animation Studios at Walt Disney Pictures and took the story with him. However, there are several references to the celebrated graphic novel \"Watchmen,\" which possibly Bird took as a base to write."

      "question": "Any recommendations for other movies by Pixar Animation Studios?",
      "answer": "If you like Pixar's animation in The Incredibles, you'll certainly want to see some of the other Pixar productions, including and its sequels-Toy Story 2 (1999) and Toy Story 3 (2010)-and perhaps A Bug's Life (1998), Monsters, Inc. (2001), Finding Nemo (2003), Cars (2006) and Cars 2 (2011), Ratatouille (2007), WALLÂ·E (2008), Up (2009), Brave (2012), Monsters University (2013) and Finding Dory (2016). Edit"

      "question": "Is Syndrome the illegitimate son of Mr. Incredible?",
      "answer": "\"Obviously, Buddy is older than Mr. Incredible's other children, as the prologue is set 15 years prior to their birth and just before Mr. Incredible's marrying of ElastiGirl. When Mr. Incredible and Buddy (Syndrome's name as a child) first meet inside the former's superhero car, there seems to be a striking resemblance. Buddy naming his unofficial alter ego IncrediBoy already suggests a role-model connection between the two, but the fact that they look like each other may argue there is a hidden father-son relationship that the narrative has kept as subtext.\""
