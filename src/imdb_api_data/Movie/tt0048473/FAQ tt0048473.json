      "answer": "From the extras on the disk, the Mother \"Sarbojaya Ray\" - Karuna Bannerjee (as Karuna Bandopadhyay) and the younger \"Durga\" - Runki (Shampa) Banerjee (as Runki Bandopadhyay) are actual mother and daughter.Other actors including \"Apu\" Subir Banerjee (Subir Bandopadhyay) and the writer (autobiographical novel (?)) Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay share the credited \"Bandyopadhyay\" and/or \"Banerjee\"?From comments on the extras I assume they are not directly related (Shampa knew little about Subirs life following \"Pather Panchali\", etc.) ? Are these names that common in Bengal/Kolkata that they are not related?"
