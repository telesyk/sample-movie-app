      "question": "Do Iranian women have to wear a headscarf in their homes as well?",
      "answer": "No, not in real life. Outside and in public, Iranian women have to wear a scarf out of chastity. At home with their own family, they do not have to wear anything to cover their hair. However, as per Iranian Islamic law, there is an exception for movies; since there will be male audience members watching, women depicted in Iranian produced movies will always have to wear a cover regardless of where they are. The director played a nice trick like including the presence of a strange man in the house all the time, e.g., the old man to the maid, the guy fixing the TV in Simin's mother house, and the lenders, or by shooting after the woman had just arrived in the house so she wouldn't have time to change her clothes or while she is ready to leave."
