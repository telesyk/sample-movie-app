      "question": "Is \"Avengers: Endgame\" based on a comic book?",
      "answer": "The film is loosely based on \"The Infinity Gauntlet\" storyline in the comic. But for the most part, is an original story made for the film. The story in the comic had Thanos wipe out life to please the personification of Death, but failed to do so. Thanos in the movie seeks to wipe out life because he thinks by doing so he can save the universe from overcrowding. Endgame is the final confrontation with him when he seeks revenge for the Avengers trying to undo his work."

    {
      "question": "Do I need to see all Marvel superhero movies before this to understand this movie?",
      "answer": "Yes. This movie is the penultimate culmination of all the 21 movies of the MCU, and if you decide to watch some of them, you may not understand the storyline because they're deeply related to other movies. Like if you watch Captain America: Civil War (2016) without watching Ant-Man (2015), you'll be confused by Ant-Man's sudden presence in Civil War. Also, if you skip Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), you won't understand Avengers: Infinity War (2018). Due to the interconnected nature of the MCU, every movie is important to fully realize the complete picture."

    {
      "question": "What did Captain \"Stevens\" refer to when he called Dr. Pym and told him he had a glowing box that made the mail guys sick?",
      "answer": "Could be he was referring to the Tesseract as it has played a key role in the movies going back to . Or highly radioactive material.Then again, considering how much \"mad science\" was going on in that place, it could have just been a generic bluff since Rogers didn't give too many details. Edit"

      "question": "Is this going to be the final Avengers movie?",
      "answer": "No. This is the final time you will see many of the original Avengers. However, more Avengers movies are sure to come, especially with newer Avengers now taking the spotlight."

    {
      "question": "Who was the young man at the back of the crowd standing by himself at the funeral?",
      "answer": "He is Harley Keener, the young boy in who helps Tony Stark recharge his suit, played by Ty Simpkins. Because this movie takes place about 10 years after IM3, he's now a teenager. Edit"

      "question": "The Avengers need a big machine to go back in time through the Quantum Space. But when back in time, they seem to be able to just \"jump\" around. (Tony and Captain A. goes back to 1970). How was this explained?",
      "answer": "The machine functioned as the anchor point they would return to when they finished their mission. Tony and Cap just changed the coordinates to go further in time when they re-entered the quantum space. Each member had an extra dose of particles to jump back to their point of origin. When they failed to get the Tesseract, Cap and Tony used their remaining particles to jump back to the 70s, because Tony knew that his father and Hank Pym worked together at that facility. So they were able to get the tesseract and extra Pym particles to return to their point of origin."

    {
      "question": "What happened to Gamora in the end? She wasn't on the Guardians ship.",
      "answer": "Moments before Thor enters the Guardian's ship, we can see Quill looking at a screen with the picture of Gamora and the word 'searching' in top of it. This implies that she fled the scene and the search for her will probably be one of the main plots of .One of the deleted scenes shows that she just went away while the remaining Avengers take a knee for the fallen Tony Stark.

    {
      "question": "How did Pepper Potts (Rescue) know to come in battle at the exact moment everybody else did?",
      "answer": "The same way everyone else knew (the Wakandans, the Asgardians, the Masters of the Mystic Arts, etc.). Doctor Strange, who knew how things needed to play out, rallied everyone."
    },
    {
      "question": "How and more exactly where did Captain America bring back the Soul Stone to Vormir?",
      "answer": "It isn't shown in the film. Captain America appears to return all the stones with no trouble."

    {
      "question": "How was Bruce able to talk in his Hulk form without turning back into his regular self?",
      "answer": "Bruce explains he had radiation treatment in order to merge the personas. (\"Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together.\")"
    },
    {
      "question": "How was Iron Man able to \"snap out\" Thanos' entire army, doesn't the snap randomly kills off 50% of the population?",
      "answer": "There are no predetermined rules for the snap. With all 6 stones you can do anything you want. Thanos CHOSE to wipe out half the universe. Hulk CHOSE to bring them back. Tony CHOSE to wipe Thanos and his army out of existence."
    },
    {
      "question": "In Infinity War, it was implied that Dr. Strange couldn't just portal back to Earth from Ebony Maw's ship. How then did he create a portal from Titan to Earth in Endgame?",
      "answer": "Creating a portal while moving at an extreme speed in space is most likely impossible for Strange. Getting the ship to stop wasn't discussed after Stark refused to take control of it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Past Thanos is killed in Endgame, so how did the events depicted in Infinity War ever happen?",
      "answer": "Hulk explains this by saying that changing the past doesn't change the future (or present). Thanos and his army dying in 2023 won't affect the main timeline but it will create another timeline in 2014 where Thanos and his army were wiped out of existence. So yes, the new 2014 timeline doesn't contain any Infinity War events."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why can Captain America lift/use Thor's hammer?",
      "answer": "Because the very idea of Captain America is that he is the best of mankind. Not that he has powers, but that he is willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Hence his story arc coming to a close: a man always willing to serve, finally getting the one thing he wants most.In an interview with Director , he suggested that Captain America was always able to pick up the hammer but didn't want to shame Thor. This is why when Cap first uses the hammer in Avengers: Endgame (2019) Thor states 'I knew it.' Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why didn't Natasha have a funeral near the end as well?",
      "answer": "Some have claimed that when the team members were discussing her death (on the dock in the Avenger compound), soon after they all returned from their \"Time Heist\" missions, that this was her \"wake\" or \"funeral\". This may be more \"wishful thinking\" than an accurate description. Clearly, Tony Stark's funeral was more important to the writers, as he was the main character that the MCU was built upon."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Tony die snapping his fingers but Bruce didn't or Thanos in the previous film?",
      "answer": "In the MCU both Thanos and Hulk are super beings, Hulk is often referred to as the equal of Thor in power -- remember the battle between Thor and Hulk in the first Avengers movie? Thor was able to block one of the Hulk's blows while telling him \"try to think!\". Thor can hold his own against beings as big and strong as the Hulk because he's already very strong as an immortal being.Tony Stark is an ordinary human being. As referenced in no mere mortal can survive the power of the stones, as was shown by the fate of The Collector's assistant when she grabbed one of the stones and was vaporised. Tony was said to be slightly protected by his suit but this didn't save his life since he simply wasn't vaporised instantly. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why wasn't Goose the Flerkin at Tony Stark's funeral too? Or Dr. Erik Selvig? Or Ti Asha, the blue girl Quill flirted with back on Xandar? Wouldn't the scene have been even more sad with even more characters in attendance?",
      "answer": "We don't really know who was there, the camera was always pretty close to the people we did see so there's possibly people out of frame we didn't see.As for why a larger funeral wasn't depicted it can be assumed that the writers wanted to make the funeral feel more personal."
    },
    {
      "question": "Captain America lifting Mj√∂lnir is fine, but how is he able to produce lightning? Wasn't it established in a previous movie that those powers come from Thor himself (a.k.a. the God of Thunder), and not from his hammer?",
      "answer": "The enchantment Odin placed upon Mj√∂lnir in went \"Whosoever holds of this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\"The hammer acts as a guidance tool for Thor himself to properly focus the power which comes from within him, but the hammer also bestows power on whomever else it deems worthy as well. Whether that energy given to Captain America is equal to that of Thor's remains unknown, though unlikely. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "So in the film Captain America goes into the past and lives out his days as Agent Carters secret husband, this would seem to put his later relationship with agent 13 (Carter's own great niece) in a rather creepy light. As she would in fact be his own great grand niece.",
      "answer": "In some ways, a little bit, but not really. While Steve Rogers did marry Peggy in an alternate timeline, this was established to be simply a parallel reality where he lived as her husband, completely incongruuous to the main timeline of events as we know it, so for all events as we know them, Steve and Sharon remain unrelated.As for the alternate timeline with Steve and Peggy growing old together, whether they even had kids in said timeline is never revealed, so there is a chance, by extension, that Sharon never existed in that timeline or grew up to be a different person entirely. In either case, the events of that timeline are separate from the main timeline we all know about and remain separate as Captain America uses the last of the Pym Particles to return to the main timeline as an old man. When traveling back in time to \"get some of that life Tony was talking about,\" it is unlikely that Cap had Sharon in mind and simply wanted to be with his lost love.There is also the fact that Cap and Sharon never actually \"dated\" or shared any real relationship, outside of briefly working together and occasionally flirting."
    },
    {
      "question": "How was it okay for Smart Hulk to reveal the future to the Ancient One, if the Avengers weren't supposed to talk about the future in the past?",
      "answer": "The rule about not mentioning future events is in place because people in the past might act differently when they know what is going to happen, and their acting differently might mean that the event that was described to them never happens at all (which is a paradox).However, the Ancient One seems not to experience time the same way. She already has some knowledge of things that will happen in the future, as evidenced by her knowing Stephen Strange will be her successor, and saying that he is supposed to be the best of the Sorcerers. She is also the keeper of the Time Stone, which puts her relation to time and knowledge on a more loose basis."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Tony say \"I am Iron Man\", before snapping his fingers was there any symbolism.",
      "answer": "It was in retort to Thanos saying \"I am inevitable\" before snapping his fingers. It was also a call back to the first film that ends with him admitting to the world that he was Iron Man, which set him on a path that led him to that final moment in Endgame. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why wouldn't Natasha allow Clint to sacrifice himself on Vormir, instead sacrificing herself.",
      "answer": "Probably because of two things. One, Clint has a family. Two, Natasha has \"red on her ledger\" as she told Loki in . This is her way of wiping the red off. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why were none of the Nova Corp members (who were first seen in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)) not present in the final battle?",
      "answer": "Thanos attacked Xandar and obtained the Power Stone before the events of , which is clear because he already has it at the beginning of that movie during the attack on the Asgardian ship. It's possible that his army destroyed the entire Nova Corps army, or weakened them enough so that they could not fight in the final battle.It's also possible that neither Doctor Strange, nor any of the other Sorcerers knew of the existence of the Nova Corps, and therefore did not make a portal through which they could join the fight.

    },
    {
      "question": "Accepting the premise that the past cannot be changed how is it that Thanos and all his minions have dual demises? How can they die twice?",
      "answer": "Technically, they didn't. In the movie, when Thanos and his army jump from the past to the present, they create a big enough impact on the time stream to create a parallel timeline, or alternate versions of themselves. In that timeline, Thanos and his army disappeared from the past, reappeared in the present and were defeated. So that VERSION of them died once.In the main timeline, it played out as shown before, so that is how the ORIGINAL VERSIONS perished.In the longer term, parallel timelines eventually fade and merge back with the main timeline, which is why our memories of the past fade and change. Even recorded history changes aspect generationally.In reality, time is not like a stream, but an ocean. When you make a small decision, like what color socks to wear today, it has the same effect as a rain drop in the ocean. However, when momentous actions are taken, the effects are like tsunamis or tidal waves. They wash up on shore to various degrees of impact, then gradually recede back to the oceanic pool over time."

      "question": "How is it that in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, it is made very clear that no mortal could hold an Infinity Stone but now all of a sudden in this movie, everyone can hold one in their hand with no trouble at all?",
      "answer": "The only mortal to hold a stone is Hawkeye, who receives the soul stone in exchange for that which he loves. The space stone is housed by the tesseract, the reality stone is extracted in the form of the aether, the mind stone is in Loki's staff, the time stone is retrieved by Hulk (who is powerful enough to wield all the stones), and the power stone is still in the orb from Guardians of the Galaxy.In fact, the scene where Hawkeye awakens in the pool and realizes he's holding a stone in his hand is more powerful when you realize, as he realizes, that this is the tiny, haunting payment for Natasha's sacrifice - he can now possess the tiny soul stone harmlessly."

      "question": "In 2016's Doctor Strange, the Ancient One refused to train Strange when he visited Kamar-Taj. If she knew the prophecy about the stone in 2012, why would she refuse to teach him?",

How do they get down to the avengers compound? Dont they normally get transported in those giant siege tower spacecraft we see in infinity war?. How do they seem to be in the tunnels chasing Hawk-eye almost immediately?",
      "answer": "I believe it's because has sort of teleporting beam coming from his ships, meaning he could beam down his troops, who are seen as fast creatures, and they got into the Avengers base."

    {
      "question": "during the final battle when everyone who thanos snapped away, Dr Strange, spiderman etc come back from Titan via Dr Strange's cosmic sparkle rings. Surely if he could do this why wait until now? In infinity war he could have brought himself, Spiderman and Ironman back to earth when they realise they couldnt turn the ship around right?",
      "answer": "Well, he and the others on Titan were blipped. I suppose they had a little time, but they were worn out and injured from fighting, and trying to formulate a plan, then Dr. Strange was dusted, so he never got the chance to teleport them away. It wouldn't have mattered much anyway, seeing as he would have gotten blipped either way."

      "question": "why at the end of endgame when Peter Parker returns to school is he of equivalent age to his classmates? Surely he should be 5 years younger than 50% of them although there is no sign of this.",

    },
    {
      "question": "If changing the past simply creates a separate reality, how can Steve appear in the main timeline as an old man when he goes back to be with Peggy?",
      "answer": "At first, this does seem to contradict the established rules of time travel in the film. However, there is a plausible explanation - assuming that interfering with the past does indeed create a separate reality, then Steve lived out the next 80 or so years in this alternate universe where he settled down with Peggy. Then when the time came (years after Peggy's death and around the same time Tony's death took place in the original timeline), he could have requested help from Hank Pym or Doctor Strange - both of whom have ways of accessing other dimensions - to return to the \"main timeline\", and assure his friends that he was OK before presumably dying.While this is a somewhat convoluted explanation, it is plausible enough to address the \"plot hole\" - and also creates the opportunity for Steve to have fixed a few things in his \"new timeline\" (such as exposing HYDRA and therefore rescuing Bucky), rather than remain quiet about them for the sake of maintaining continuity."
