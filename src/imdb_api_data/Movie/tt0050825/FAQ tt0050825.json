      "question": "Is \"Paths of Glory\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "Paths of Glory is based on a 1935 novel by Humphrey Cobb, who served in the Canadian army during WWI and fought in the battle of Amiens. The book had no title when it was finished, so the publisher held a contest. The winning entry came from the ninth stanza of the famous Thomas Gray poem Elegy Written in a Country Church-yard: The boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,/ And all that beauty, all that wealth e'er gave,/ Awaits alike th' inevitable hour:-/ The paths of glory lead but to the grave."
