      "question": "Why does the Realtor makes a \"joke\" about the possibility of Colin having \"eating issues\"?",
      "answer": "It's likely a lame joke he tells to anyone who views the apartment. As he mentions the fridge has an alarm on it. While this wasn't a common device when the movie came out; most modern refrigerators have an alarm that goes off when the door has been left open too long. This helps save energy by reminding you to close the door or in case you didn't close it properly when you finished with it.So the joke the realtor is implying is that if the fridge alarm goes off it would be because Colin was eating directly out of the fridge. Which is obviously not a very funny joke."

      "question": "Is \"The Departed\" based on a true story?",
      "answer": "The Departed, and the character of Frank Costello, is loosely based on the story of Whitey Bulger (born 1929), a Boston Southie considered by law enforcement to be one of the last Irish mobsters. Bulger often gave information to John Connolly, an FBI agent, on the Italian Mafia in Boston, in order to take over the city himself.Bulger spent his career as a psychotic killer and even ran guns for the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in the 1970s. Even after Bulger stopped passing on actual information to the FBI, Connolly still protected him from imprisonment. Bulger was captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011 after being on the run for over 15 years and, in 2013, was found guilty of 31 counts of various felonies including racketeering, money laundering, extortion, and weapons charges, including complicity in 11 murders, for which was sentenced to two consecutive life terms plus five years. He was murdered in USP Hazelton on October 30, 2018 at the age of 89."

      "question": "What was in the small box that Frank gives to Colin in the car?",
      "answer": "Most likely, it was the key to his new apartment.William Monahan's screenplay, \"COLIN flips open the top and then quickly closes it. NOTE: The box could contain an eyeball, money, drugs, a picture of Colin fucking his school teacher . . . we will never know.\""
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did the Realtor say to Colin, \"This is kind of a large apartment\"?",
      "answer": "When Colin says that he's a State Police Detective, the Realtor asks if he is married. Colin says no, at which point the Realtor says, \"Because this is kind of a large apartment\". Not only is the apartment large for one person, but the realtor is likely wondering how a young police officer on a single income can afford the rent alone, implying that Colin is either stupid with his money, buying an apartment he can't afford, or accepts bribes which allows him to be able to afford it. Colin is clearly offended by the statement either way and informs the realtor that he has a co-signer."

    {
      "question": "What is Mr. French's real name?",
      "answer": "This is not stated in the film. When Billy asks, Frank tells him that \"Mr. French\" () is an alias. In one scene, however, Frank calls Mr. French \"Arnold\" a few times, so it's possible that Arnold is Mr. French's first name. Edit"

      "question": "Why are many cops of Irish descent?",
      "answer": "An early British police force was the Constabulary of Ireland founded in 1822 (later given the royal appointment and renamed the Royal Irish Constabulary). It followed the original Bow Street Runners (created in1749) who subsequently became the London Metropolitan Police.This established a long tradition of law enforcement running in Irish families worldwide, especially as many RIC officers migrated from Ireland to America after the violence surrounding Ireland's partition in 1922 and joined American police forces.In addition, during the 19th century, many corrupt, Irish-dominated local governments such as New York City's infamous Tammany Hall would reward their supporters with lucrative civil service jobs in the police force and fire department, often using the former as an instrument of political power."

      "question": "Why is Staff Sergeant Dignam such a jerk?",
      "answer": "Throughout the entire film, Staff Sergeant Sean Dignam is often seen as a bully to nearly every character, except his boss Captain Queenan. It seems to those who work for him, such as Billy Costigan, he berates them to get them to toughen up and be realistic about what their profession entails.When Dignam tells Costigan that as hard as he may try he will not be a cop due to his background, even though he says it in a mean degrading way, he is being 100% honest and trying to wake Billy up to say if you wanna be a cop, you must go through these channels and be the ultimate undercover agent. He does not hate Costigan, as he ends up avenging him and Queenan in the end by killing Sullivan. He also does have respect for him, as when he reveals to Costigan about the spy inside the special investigation's unit.As for the rest of the people, he most likely has disdain for them. Such as Sullivan, who he has suspicions about since the start of the film. Sullivan perceives this as him being jealous of his status and fast climbing of the ladder. While Dignam is not jealous, he believes something is not right about Sullivan and that he has connections to Costello. He believes that the FBI is always trying to force their way into their investigations and bully them around, and he just comes across as brutally honest, that he does not like them and to stay out of their business.Dignam is a jerk because he truly cares about the people under his unit, and wants them to stay alive in the field and not go crazy in the process. He also is a jerk because he does not like certain people and usually has a good reason for having them on his bad side. He picks and chooses his battles, and gives people the ultimate tough love."

    {
      "question": "In the movie theater, Costello and Sullivan are sitting together, and this is seen by Costigan. Why doesn't Costigan report this back to Queenan or Dignam?",
      "answer": "If you watch the entire sequence carefully, Billy Costigan never sees Colin Sullivan's face. This is why Billy follows Colin out in to the street, in the hopes of finding out who Frank's rat in the police department was. Likewise, when Colin realizes he's being followed, he never sees Billy's face either."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did the Chinese get caught with the computer chips?",
      "answer": "Costello arranged to sell the computer chips to the Chinese, but likely had no intention of actually delivering the real chips. (Queenan observes that they may be at war with the Chinese in the future and Costello's selling them military hardware.) Frank was an FBI informant, so he tipped off the FBI to apprehend them, therefore Frank keeps the money, and the Chinese get arrested."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was Delahunt a cop?",
      "answer": "This is left ambiguous. Given the fact that Delahunt helped the rest of Frank's crew kill Queenan, it's likely he wasn't an undercover officer. There are two hints that he may have been undercover, however.1. Shortly before dying; Delahunt tells Billy that he gave him the wrong address, but Billy showed up at the right one, then rhetorically asked why he didn't tell anyone. This may have been because Delahunt knew or figured out that Billy was undercover, but as he was too, wasn't going to give him up.2. The local news states that Delahunt was an undercover cop, but Frank dismisses the report as misinformation to protect the real undercover officer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who killed the two Italian hitmen from Providence?",
      "answer": "Colin and Frank frame a man named Jimmy Pappas for the hit to cover up the fact that Frank ordered both men to be murdered in order to save Billy from execution after he severely beat two of the Italian gangsters in a store. It's never revealed who really killed the two men, but it would be safe to assume that it was Mr. French, along with either Fitzy or Delahunt."
