      "question": "Is this film based on a true story?",
      "answer": "Yes. It is very loosely based on the life of , one of the most famous newspaper publishers of all time.

    {
      "question": "Why does Kane collect so many things?",

    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "Susan suggests that Thompson talk with Kane's butler Raymond () (\"He knows where all the bodies are buried\"), but all Raymond can tell him is that he was in the room when Kane died holding the snowglobe and uttering \"rosebud.\" Later, as all the reporters gather at Xanadu in the big entry hall where the packing crates and statues are being taken prior to sale, Thompson admits to the other reporters that he never found out what \"rosebud\" meant, adding that it doesn't matter. \"I don't think it explains anything. I don't think any word explains a man's life,\" he says. \"Rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle...a missing piece.\" The camera then pans across the piles and piles of items that Kane collected, finally resting on the sled he was playing with just before his mother turned him over to Walter Thatcher (George Coulouris) to raise. A worker picks up the sled and tosses it into a furnace along with other junk they are burning up. Across the top of the sled, the word \"Rosebud\" is clearly visible. As the flames consume the sled, the scene shifts to an exterior shot of Xanadu where smoke can be seen billowing out of the massive chimney. In the final scene, the camera pans out past the chain-link fence with the \"No trespassing\" sign on it. Edit"

    {
      "question": "Why does this film have the reputation as the greatest of all time?",
      "answer": "Citizen Kane won a reputation as the greatest film ever made when it topped the 1962 Sight and Sound poll. It held the top spot for 50 years until it fell to second behind . The film is commonly praised for its intricate plot, filled with flashbacks that shuffle the chronology of Kane's life, its extraordinary performances, its marvelous technical stunts, and its deep-focus photography. Few if any of the technical effects are entirely original to Kane, but Orson Welles and his crew's masterly use of so many of them in one film has made Citizen Kane an influence on nearly everything that came after.
