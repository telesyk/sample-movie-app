      "question": "In the opening scene, Monco lights a cigar with his left hand. Is Clint Eastwood left handed?",
      "answer": "Yes. Clint Eastwood is left-handed in real life. Therefore, Monco is too. (we even see him grab a pen and cross out a name in a ledger with his left hand). In the saloon, we see him using his left hand to deal cards, and even slap around his bounty. This is also partially because Monco wanted to keep his right hand on his gun in case anyone drew on him.If you watch Eastwood's films he generally shoots with his right hand but does most other actions with his left. This is called \"cross-dominant\" or sometimes \"mixed-dominant\". For example someone might eat, drink and write with their left hand but swing a bat, shoot, or throw a ball with their right."

      "question": "How old is Colonel Douglas Mortimer? His younger sister had to be in her 20s when she died.",
      "answer": "Douglas Mortimer is likely the age that Lee Van Cleef was at the time of filming (39-40). Rosemary Dexter who played Mortimer's sister was 20-21 at the time. It's possible that she was playing older than she was. We also don't know how long it's been since Indio attacked her. If it was 10 years prior, then the age gap may not have been as significant between them."

      "question": "Was Tomaso (Lorenzo Robledo) originally a member of Indio's Gang before he married a woman & had a baby? Since Indio tells him that he took money to put him behind bars?",
      "answer": "It's possible Tomaso was just the bounty hunter that captured Indio and turned him in for a reward. Otherwise, yes it's possible Tomaso was a member of the gang and simply betrayed Indio and set him up to be arrested."

      "question": "Is this movie based on a book?",
      "answer": "No. For a Few Dollars More (Per qualche dollaro in più ) is based on a script written by Italian screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni and director Sergio Leone, known for his \"spaghetti westerns\". It is a sequel to A Fistful of Dollars () (1964). There is also a third movie in what is known as \"The Dollar Trilogy\"—The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966)) (1966). Edit"

      "question": "Do I need to watch these films in order?",
      "answer": "Those who have seen all three movies say that it's not important to watch them in order, considering that none of them follow the same story or include the same characters, other than Clint Eastwood. The only other similiarities would include the direction and the music. However, others recommend that they be watched in order to see the progression of Leone's works as the production values got better and better. In historical chronology (based on the weapons used) the film order is The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1862 American Civil War and Colt Navy revolvers), For A Few Dollars More (Colt SAA Peacemakers post 1873 but more likely 1885; Indio's Colt SAA has gutta percha grips, which were in the 1884 Colt catalog), and A Fistful of Dollars (fully automatic machine guns issue from late 1890s and khaki Mexican uniforms from the turn of the century)."

      "question": "Why are the titles of Leone's Westerns in Italian?",
      "answer": "Because they are Italian films with an international cast, filmed in both Almeria Spain, and Rome's Cinecitta Studios, not to mention the fact that Leone is Italian himself."

    {
      "question": "In what year is the film supposed to take place?",
      "answer": "The thickness of the newspaper archive binder that Mortimer looks through in El Paso when he is trying to discover more about his rival bounty hunter provides a clue regarding the time period. Upon close inspection, the front page halftone image appears to show that the Marton Brothers were killed in far off Red Hill Montana, and it was back in 1872. If Mortimer finds Monco at the center of that binder, that means the last page of the archive would bring us to the present day. At four to six pages per issue, that's a lot of papers, and assuming that in a place like El Paso they didn't publish every day, that binder can represent years. Another clue is Mortimer's attire: he wearing a tie with a \"four in hand\" knot. That style was invented in England at Oxford around 1880. We know that on May 19, 1881: Southern Pacific tracks reach El Paso, Texas, and that \" The Rock Island continued its trek westward and soon added \"Pacific\" to the end of its name as a final destination goal. A line to Colorado Springs was completed in 1888 and trackage rights to Denver was acquired in 1889. A line southwest across Kansas stretched to Tucumcari by the mid-1890s and a connection was completed with the Southern Pacific, thus completing the Pacific goal\" in 1901. If we go by these clues the archive binder, Mortimer's tie, and the historical record for the railroads (the key is railroads in both Tucumcari & El Paso) For a Few Dollars More could take place as late as the Turn of the Cenyury, which would put it closer in time to A Fistful of Dollars. There is a set of either phone or telegraph lines in one scene that are shot at, and a telegraph system is seen to be in use, which would also place the film in the 1890s at the earliest."

      "question": "Does the Man With No Name actually have a name?",
      "answer": "In every film he has a different name: in A Fistful of Dollars he is called Joe, in For A Few Dollars More, he is called Monco, and in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly he is named Blondie. Of the three names, Monco is likely his real name, because in Fistful he never says his name; the undertaker just starts calling him Joe, as it's a common name. Blondie is just the nickname Tuco gives him because, once again, he didn't reveal his name. However, in For A Few Dollars More, the sheriff is talking about the bounty hunter named Monco, which is the name he signed in the ledger, so it is likely his true name or at least the name he goes by. On the other hand, \"Monco\" actually means \"one-armed\", and as The Man With No Name does everything left-handed, this could be either a joke or a pseudonym and not his real name at all.He is playing a different character in each movie, so he wouldn't likely have the same name in each film anyway."

      "question": "What are the differences between the MGM cuts and the German DVD cut?",
      "answer": "All MGM widescreen releases are slightly censored. They're missing the scene in which Indio stops the beating of Monco and Mortimer. This scene can be found on the German DVD by Paramount."

    {
      "question": "What are the differences between the MGM Blu-ray cut and the Italian Blu-ray cut?",
      "answer": "The UK Blu-ray disc lacks 6 scenes with a total length of 44 seconds. The first four cuts are equal to the German DVD. But the last cut is exclusively on the UK Blu-ray disc. The sixth cut has also been made for the German versions but only the first 10 seconds. The remaining 15 sec are exlusively on the UK Blu-ray version again. But the Italian Blu-ray version is missing one scene as well that can be found in the German TV version, which is missing another scene."

      "question": "Which character is the 'brother' to the 'sister' in the locket?",
      "answer": "The critic's commentary on the DVD release states that Mortimer is the brother to the young women raped by Indio. However, Leone could be manipulating things to create some ambiguity here, allowing for other interpretations.For one, Indio is notably tortured by the memory of the incident. Why, if he's a killer outlaw, would this bother him so much? If the woman is his own sister, that could explain it (also adding motive to the woman's suicide). The man who is shot in the scene bears a resemblance to Mortimer (much younger). Although he apparently dies in the scene, we don't really know. If this is Mortimer, it gives him a stronger motive for revenge.Another possible indicator of Indio being the brother comes in the buildup of the climactic duel We get camera cuts between the three characters, with Clint looking at each one, with the open locket in his hand. At one point, he seems to notice something in the picture, then looks up at Indio. Is this meant to be a connection? The viewer can decide."

      "question": "How did Colonel Mortimer lose his other pocket watch by the time Monco found it in the final showdown?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Indio say to Monco, \"You shouldn't have shot the apples off that tree\"?",
      "answer": "Monco kills people only if it is absolutely necessary or they deserve to die. Indio sends him into Agua Caliente to show off his shooting skills, but Monco doesn't think it right to kill three people who are only defending their town, just to prove a point to Indio and his gang. Instead, he shoots apples on a tree to prove himself. Unfortunately, this confirms Indio's theory that Monco is a bounty hunter, because Indio assumes that a criminal who's a great shot would have no problem killing three gunmen. When Indio captures Monco, he says this line because the apple shooting gave Monco away."
