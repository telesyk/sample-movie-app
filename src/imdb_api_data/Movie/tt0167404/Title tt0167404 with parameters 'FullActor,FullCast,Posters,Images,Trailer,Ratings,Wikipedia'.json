Vincent Grey, a former patient Malcolm had treated for hallucinations, breaks into their house and accuses Malcolm of failing him before shooting Malcolm and then himself.\r\nMonths later, Malcolm begins working with Cole Sear, a 9-year-old boy who reminds him of Vincent. He feels he must help Cole to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with Anna, who has become distant and cold. Cole's mother, Lynn, worries about his social skills, especially after seeing signs of physical harm. At a birthday party, Cole is cornered by bullies who lock him in a cupboard, causing him to scream in terror before passing out. Following this incident, Cole finally confides to Malcolm that he sees ghosts walking around like the living, but they only see what they want to see and are unaware that they are dead.\r\nMalcolm thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case, but after listening to an audiotape from a session with Vincent, he hears a man tearfully begging for help in Spanish and realizes that the ghosts Cole sees are real. He suggests that Cole try to communicate with the ghosts and help them finish their business, to which Cole hesitantly agrees.\r\nCole awakens one night to discover a ghost girl vomiting. He finds out who she is and goes with Malcolm to the funeral reception at her home. Cole sneaks into the girl's room, where she crawls out from under her bed and gives him a box containing a videotape, which he gives to her father. The tape reveals the girl's step-mother poisoning her food, alerting her father to this and saving her younger sister from the same fate.\r\nBefore parting ways with Malcolm, Cole suggests that he try speaking to Anna while she is asleep to communicate better with her.\r\nWhile stuck in traffic, Cole tells his mother his secret and says that someone died in an accident down the road. When Lynn does not believe him, Cole tells her his late grandmother visits him and describes how she saw Lynn in a dance performance when she was a child, giving details that he could not have known. Cole's mother finally accepts the fact that her son has a special ability and tearfully embraces him.\r\nMalcolm returns home to find Anna talking in her sleep, asking Malcolm why he left her, much to his confusion. When she suddenly drops Malcolm's wedding ring, he notices that it is not on his finger. Recalling what Cole told him about dead people only seeing what they want to see and not knowing they are dead, Malcolm finally realizes he did not survive being shot by Vincent and has been dead while working with Cole. He quickly comes to terms with his death and tells Anna that he loves her. She bids him goodnight, indicating that she is now at peace and can move on. With his business finally complete, Malcolm's spirit departs in a flash of light.\r\nCast\r\nBruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe\r\nHaley Joel Osment as Cole Sear\r\nToni Collette as Lynn Sear\r\nOlivia Williams as Anna Crowe\r\nDonnie Wahlberg as Vincent Grey\r\nGlenn Fitzgerald as Sean\r\nMischa Barton as Kyra Collins\r\nTrevor Morgan as Tommy Tammisimo\r\nBruce Norris as Mr. Stanley Cunningham\r\nAngelica Page as Mrs. Collins\r\nGreg Wood as Mr. Collins\r\nM. Night Shyamalan as Dr. Hill\r\nPeter Tambakis as Darren\r\nJeffrey Zubernis as Bobby\r\nProduction\r\nDavid Vogel, then-president of production of Walt Disney Studios, read Shyamalan's spec script and loved it. Without obtaining corporate approval, Vogel bought the rights, despite the price of $3 million and the stipulation that Shyamalan could direct the film. Disney dismissed Vogel from his position at the studio, and Vogel left the company shortly thereafter. Disney sold the production rights to Spyglass Entertainment, while retaining the distribution rights and 12.5% of the film's box office takings.\r\nDuring the casting process for the role of Cole Sear, Shyamalan had been apprehensive about Osment's video audition, saying later he was \"this really sweet cherub, kind of beautiful, blond boy\". Shyamalan saw the role as darker and more brooding but felt that Osment \"nailed it with the vulnerability and the need ...

      "html": "<p>The Sixth Sense is a 1999 American psychological thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It stars Bruce Willis as a child psychologist whose patient (Haley Joel Osment) claims he can see and talk to the dead.</p><p>Released by Buena Vista Pictures (through its Hollywood Pictures label) on August 6, 1999, critics praised its performances (particularly those of Willis, Osment, and Toni Collette), atmosphere, direction and twist ending. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Shyamalan, Best Supporting Actor for Osment, and Best Supporting Actress for Collette. The film established Shyamalan as a predominant thriller screenwriter/director and introduced the cinema public to his traits, most notably his affinity for surprise endings.</p><p>It was the second-highest-grossing film of 1999, making roughly $293 million in the US and $379 million in other markets.</p><br/><h3>Plot</h3><p>Philadelphia-based child psychologist Malcolm Crowe returns home with his wife, Anna, after having been honored for his work. Vincent Grey, a former patient Malcolm had treated for hallucinations, breaks into their house and accuses Malcolm of failing him before shooting Malcolm and then himself.</p><p>Months later, Malcolm begins working with Cole Sear, a 9-year-old boy who reminds him of Vincent. He feels he must help Cole to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with Anna, who has become distant and cold. Cole's mother, Lynn, worries about his social skills, especially after seeing signs of physical harm. At a birthday party, Cole is cornered by bullies who lock him in a cupboard, causing him to scream in terror before passing out. Following this incident, Cole finally confides to Malcolm that he sees ghosts walking around like the living, but they only see what they want to see and are unaware that they are dead.</p><p>Malcolm thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case, but after listening to an audiotape from a session with Vincent, he hears a man tearfully begging for help in Spanish and realizes that the ghosts Cole sees are real. He suggests that Cole try to communicate with the ghosts and help them finish their business, to which Cole hesitantly agrees.</p><p>Cole awakens one night to discover a ghost girl vomiting. He finds out who she is and goes with Malcolm to the funeral reception at her home. Cole sneaks into the girl's room, where she crawls out from under her bed and gives him a box containing a videotape, which he gives to her father. The tape reveals the girl's step-mother poisoning her food, alerting her father to this and saving her younger sister from the same fate.</p><p>Before parting ways with Malcolm, Cole suggests that he try speaking to Anna while she is asleep to communicate better with her.</p><p>While stuck in traffic, Cole tells his mother his secret and says that someone died in an accident down the road. When Lynn does not believe him, Cole tells her his late grandmother visits him and describes how she saw Lynn in a dance performance when she was a child, giving details that he could not have known. Cole's mother finally accepts the fact that her son has a special ability and tearfully embraces him.</p><p>Malcolm returns home to find Anna talking in her sleep, asking Malcolm why he left her, much to his confusion. When she suddenly drops Malcolm's wedding ring, he notices that it is not on his finger. Recalling what Cole told him about dead people only seeing what they want to see and not knowing they are dead, Malcolm finally realizes he did not survive being shot by Vincent and has been dead while working with Cole. He quickly comes to terms with his death and tells Anna that he loves her. She bids him goodnight, indicating that she is now at peace and can move on. With his business finally complete, Malcolm's spirit departs in a flash of light.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Bruce Willis as Malcolm Crowe</li><li>Haley Joel Osment as Cole Sear</li><li>Toni Collette as Lynn Sear</li><li>Olivia Williams as Anna Crowe</li><li>Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent Grey</li><li>Glenn Fitzgerald as Sean</li><li>Mischa Barton as Kyra Collins</li><li>Trevor Morgan as Tommy Tammisimo</li><li>Bruce Norris as Mr. Stanley Cunningham</li><li>Angelica Page as Mrs. Collins</li><li>Greg Wood as Mr. Collins</li><li>M.

Disney dismissed Vogel from his position at the studio, and Vogel left the company shortly thereafter. Disney sold the production rights to Spyglass Entertainment, while retaining the distribution rights and 12.5% of the film's box office takings.</p><p>During the casting process for the role of Cole Sear, Shyamalan had been apprehensive about Osment's video audition, saying later he was \"this really sweet cherub, kind of beautiful, blond boy\".
