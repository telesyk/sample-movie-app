      "answer": "It was classified documents. For Willard's eyes only. Also, if he was found with them, they would know he was specifically sent for Kurtz."

      "answer": "The Redux version adds in the following which increases the run time to about 3 hours and 15 minutes: 1) Extended scenes with Kilgore including a scene where the crew steals Kilgore's surfboard 2) A scene where the crew meets the Playboy Bunnies again and Willard trades fuel for some time with them for the boys to keep moral up 3) A fight between Clean and Chef on the boat (we can hear this fight in the background in the Theatrical Cut however cannot make out what they are saying) 4) An extended sequence where after Clean's death the crew stops by a French plantation and Willard has an affair with one of the women 5) An additional scene between Willard and Kurtz where Kurtz reads Willard a magazine article about the war 6) Also the Redux version moves the scene where Lance waterskies from before the crew meets Kilgore to afterThe Final Cut once again removes: (2), (3), and (5) while keeping (1) and (6) and it trims (4) by about 5 minutes. The final cut runs a little over 3 hours."

      "question": "When do the events of this story take place?",
      "answer": "No precise date is given however, Chef receives a care package late in the film that contains a news clipping about the Manson Family murders, which took place in August of 1969. We can therefore assume that the article was sent to Chef within a few weeks of it being clipped."

    {
      "question": "Did the crew really kill the water buffalo?",
      "answer": "No. The water buffalo was slaughtered by the Ifugao people you see on film for their own (ritual) purposes. They are a tribe that were used as the extras in the Kurtz compound. The crew claims that Coppola gave directions to the Ifugao people and brought them many buffalo to slaughter but only used one of the takes. Coppola tries to downplay his involvement in the event, The idea of using it in the film was brought to Coppola by his wife, Eleanor, who witnessed the ritual amongst the Ifugao prior to the scene's filming."

      "question": "Are the articles that Kurtz reads from the Redux version real?",
      "answer": "Kurtz reads from two Time Magazine articles. The second one has no date but the first one does: September 22, 1967. That article, titled \"On the Horizon\" is a real article. When Kurtz reads from it, he gives the title \"War on the Horizon\", but the original title does not have the word \"war\" in it. Without a date attached to it, the validity of the second article can't be confirmed. The first article can be read here."

      "question": "What happens to the surfing conditions after the napalm strike? (Redux Edition)",
      "answer": "When Kilgore orders the jungle near the village to be napalmed, it creates a wall of heat that disrupts the breeze coming in from the ocean. Since the breeze creates the waves necessary for surfing, the waves die out. Essentially, the firebombing Kilgore ordered has altered the weather conditions themselves.To be totally accurate on this, an offshore breeze is required to build surf and \"hold up\" the waves so that they are surf-able. The napalm strike (were it real) would have sucked in a lot of the surrounding oxygen (air) and basically killed the offshore breeze that was creating the surf in the first place. The surf was rubbish anyway and not suitable for riding...as Kilgore points out."

      "question": "What exactly did Kurtz do to warrant the military to send an assassin after him?",
      "answer": "Kurtz had been privy to top secret, sensitive information, had ordered the deaths of people without clearance, committed desertion and set up a cult deep in the jungle. Leaving him alive was too much of a risk. As his motivations were mysterious and unpredictable."

    {
      "question": "What does \"terminate with extreme prejudice\" mean?",
      "answer": "It's essentially a more sophisticated way of saying show no mercy. The agent that says this is telling Willard not to think about Kurtz, not consider what Kurtz has to say, but simply find him and kill him immediately. They knew that the first man they sent in to kill Kurtz, Colby wound up being brainwashed by Kurtz and joined his cult."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who were all the dead bodies around Kurtz's camp?",
      "answer": "There's a few possibilities;1) They were Vietcong soldiers that had attacked Kurtz and his cult.2) they were the previous occupants of the temple.3) they were members of Kurtz's cult that had angered Kurtz and so he had them killed. Or they were ritualistically sacrificed.4) they were people who refused to \"convert\" to Kurtz's cult.5) a mixture of all the above."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is meant by the ending sequence where the temple sets are destroyed by explosions?",
      "answer": "Universally interpreted as by the audience as Willard calling in an airstrike to destroy Kurtz's followers (just as he wished, \"Drop the bomb, exterminate the brutes\"), employing the codeword on the radio he instructed Chef to use in order to do just that. However this was never Coppola's intention and in the redux version the final scene is re-edited to simply show Willard turning off the radio, leaving it ambiguous."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Willard save Lance yet not Colby?",
      "answer": "Because he considers him too far gone, captured by Kurtz's insanity and unfit to return to civilization. For Lance he still holds out hope."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Willard object to the search of the sampan?",
      "answer": "Willard's mission had priority over any other operations the crew of the PBR might have. The mission was to get Willard close to Kurtz' compound and drop him off-though, because of the top secret nature of it, Willard didn't tell Chief Phillips what the parameters were. When Phillips spotted the sampan and stopped it for an inspection, it was a routine action. However, Willard, having been on many secret missions before, objected thinking that it would cause him and the crew trouble, which it did."
    },
    {
      "question": "What Happened to the puppy that Chef and Lance found on the sampan?",
      "answer": "The actual fate of the dog that Chef found in the river boat is left ambigous. The most logical explanation is that the dog was knocked off the boat and swam to shore. It's possible that, given the young age of the pup, it was not able to swim. However, most dogs have the instinct within them to know how to swim at least short distances. But its fate is left to the viewer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Willard so coldly shoot the girl on the sampan?",
      "answer": "There are three possible interpretations, and certainly many more:1. She was hit with several bullets and dying. Willard shot her knowing they'd never get her to a medical facility in time.2. If it was possible for her to live, there are likely not enough provisions (food, water) on the boat for anyone else in addition to the crew. Another movie where this theme is addressed is . In that film, after firing torpedoes at a British cargo ship, the U-boat captain leaves the survivors of the British ship in the water even after hearing their cries for help. He knows that a U-Boat simply cannot accommodate prisoners.3. (Most probable) Willard's mission had priority over everything else and he'd warned the Chief of that before they inspected the sampan (\"You wouldn't even be in this part of the river if it weren't for me\"). Through much of the film, Willard and the Chief lock horns over Willard's mission vs the duty of the boat crew, which is a minor theme of the story. Willard's mission does indeed have priority, but the Chief still feels his duty is to the duties set forth by his own superiors, which include patrolling the river for any enemy forces or those suspected of assisting them. Phillips does say very quickly when they see the sampan that boats like these have been supplying the enemy. Willard staunchly disagrees but the Chief still goes ahead with the inspection.Additionally, like Willard says in his voice-over shortly after the sampan incident, \"Those boys were never gonna look at me the same way again.\" It's likely that Willard wanted just that; to make the crew and the Chief realize that Willard is not simply one of them, but a man charged with a top secret mission. To do the job, he has to be a cold-blooded killer and felt the crew needed to know it. Edit"

    {
      "question": "What happened to the photojournalist?",
      "answer": "In the film, the photojournalist's ultimate fate is left ambiguous. He is last seen telling Willard that Kurtz has started to go too far and that he is running away. There is a deleted scene available on the Complete Dossier DVD in which the photojournalist tells Willard that he took a picture of Kurtz and that everyone will soon kill him. He is immediately found by Colby and shot."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why Did Kurtz Kill Chef?",
      "answer": "The exact reasons for Chef's decapitation are never actually made clear. Chef is last seen on the boat either trying to call for an air strike (for the Army to firebomb Kurtz' compound) OR simply conducting a radio test. One explanation could be that Kurtz knew this and killed him to prevent him from succeeding. Note that later on, just before Willard leaves to kill Kurtz, and at the very end, someone can be heard on the radio trying to contact the boat, implying that the previous conversation had been cut off abruptly, most likely because Chef was attacked and killed either by Kurtz himself or a native following his orders. If this was the case, then Kurtz presumably wanted to make an example of Chef, and dropped his head on Willard's lap as a warning. A second interpretation is that Willard finds Kurtz's notebook in which Kurtz wrote a note for Willard that says \"Drop the bomb, kill them all!\" so he killed Chef because he assumed Willard would tell Chef to order the strike if Willard did not return to the boat in a certain amount of time, which would kill Kurtz, Willard, and everyone else. Kurtz wanted to die honorably, hand to hand by a fellow soldier, but a bombing death wouldn't fulfill that wish. Willard even states that he believes this to be the case. A third interpretation is Kurtz wanted to show Willard the face of the horror. A fourth interpretation is that Kurtz heard about Chef's language towards his people and himself, and was offended by it. After all Lance was spared, likely due to him embracing the insanity."

      "question": "What's the song that plays over the beginning of the film?",
      "answer": "\"The End\" by . It's from the band's 1st, self-titled album, released in 1967. The song is nearly 12 minutes long. Interestingly, the version heard in the film is the original, uncensored version where Morrison can be heard chanting the word \"fuck\" several times. This original version can be found on Legacy: the Absolute Best compilation. The track is also used at the end during the scene where Willard kills Kurtz. Edit"
