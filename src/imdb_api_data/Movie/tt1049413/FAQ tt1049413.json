      "question": "How does Russell end up on Carl's porch after his house takes off?",
      "answer": "Russell tells Carl that he was searching for the Snipe under his porch. Later in the movie, after the house is relaunched, Dug also knocks at the door and says that he was hiding under the porch when it took off. Apparently, the porch has a floor underneath which goes with the house when it is airborne. Another possibility is that both Russell and Dug hang on to the underside of the porch when it takes off and then climb up onto the porch in order to get inside the house. In the short film \"George & A.J.\" an attempt is made to handwave this by showing Russell bracing himself underneath the house as it takes off."

      "question": "Is it actually possible to lift up a house with helium filled ballons?",
      "answer": "If Carl's house was approximately 1,600 square feet (150 square meters), and the average house weighs between 60 and 100 pounds per square foot (300 and 500 kilograms per square meter), then Carl's house weighs around 120,000 pounds (54,000 kilograms). If the average helium balloon can carry .009 pounds (or 4 grams), it would take over 12,658,392 balloons to lift his house off the ground. 20,622 balloons appear on the house when it first lifts off, but tearing the house out of the ground and being able to maneuver it is another story."

      "question": "How is it that Carl and Muntz look about the same age when they meet? Shouldn't Muntz be dead by then?",
      "answer": "Paradise Falls was called a land lost in time.It is implied that there is a magic there that allows Muntz to stop aging, and keeps him healthy. Even Carl has no use for his walker after only a few hours there.It's an analogy about purpose, when these men had a goal to achieve it kept them strong and youthful.Also, there was allegedly a deleted scene explaining that feeding on Kevin's species's eggs would keep one healthy and even prevent ageing. This means to underline Muntz's terrible evil as he would rob a species of their youth for his own survival."
