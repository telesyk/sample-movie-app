      "question": "Who set the first bomb: the French or the Arabs?",
      "answer": "It was the French setting the bomb. The movie shows the group of French men gathered at one of their houses then setting out to what they tell the wife is going to be a casual get-together. They get past the guard into the Arab sector, then place the bomb in front of a house. Their plan was to plant a bomb and then blame it on the terrorists, thereby winning back Arab support by promising that the French would protect them."
