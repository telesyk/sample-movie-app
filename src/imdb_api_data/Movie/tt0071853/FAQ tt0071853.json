      "question": "Why does Tim the Enchanter all of a sudden disappear when Arthur and his knights charge at the killer rabbit?",
      "answer": "When the knights first meet Tim the Enchanter (played by John Cleese), Sir Lancelot disappears and does not appear in any of the shots in which Tim also appears (because Sir Lancelot is also played by John Cleese. To replace him, an extra was dressed in Lancelot's armor and wore Lancelot's helmet, he's the one just over Arthur's left shoulder when they first peer at the cave). However when the knights charge at the rabbit it becomes necessary for John Cleese to play Sir Lancelot again so therefore Tim could not be in the shot (it can be assumed he walked off in between shots).Story-wise, it's possible Tim stopped accompanying the Knights when it became clear they were going to foolishly charge the rabbit against his warnings."

      "question": "Why does the French Knight call King Arthur and his men \"Kaniggets\"? What does that mean?",
      "answer": "He's actually referring to them as \"Knights.\" However, either his grasp of English isn't very good or he's deliberately mocking English spelling and pronunciation. As a result, he says the word phonetically, pronouncing both the K and the G (which are silent). In medieval English, in fact, the \"K\" and \"GH\" were pronounced (that's why the word is spelled that way), so that \"Knight\" sounded a bit like \"k'nnect.\" The joke might have occurred to Terry Jones or another Python who had encountered medieval literature."

      "question": "Was it Sir Lancelot who killed the historian?",
      "answer": "No, it was actually Singing Camelot Knight #4 however both characters are actually played by John Cleese so it's easy to make the mistake of thinking it was Sir Lancelot."
