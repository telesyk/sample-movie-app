      "question": "Why does Leon always drink milk?",
      "answer": "The milk is visually ironic. Léon is a master hitman. He's a big, strong man who does airborne crunches with his legs wedged under a dinner table. He can disappear in and out of a location to assassinate a dozen men without being seen - and then he goes home to drink some milk. It's not what one expects, and adds a layer of complexity to his persona. Metaphorically, it's a symbol of wholesomeness and his paternal concern for Mathilda. He attempts to enrich her and provide her with a more wholesome environment, and milk represents those qualities. It's a fluid of life, nurture, and care. Additionally, it's a fluid of innocence and, in the case of both Léon and Mathilda, childhood. Léon represents childhood in the ways that Mathilda does not; he does not know how to read, he finds great pleasure in simple entertainment, he has no apparent sexual desires or relationships. He is, on many levels, more immature than Mathilda. And she, though an actual child, is intellectually superior to Léon, dresses beyond her years, and is raised in an environment that exposed her to many things children shouldn't have to deal with. At one point in the film he merely says, \"I like to stay in shape.\""

      "question": "What are the differences among the theatrical cut, the director's cut, and the extended cut?",
      "answer": "It is often reported that due to poor test screenings in the US, Luc Besson cut out nearly 25 minutes for the US theatrical release of the film, primarily depicting more of the interactions and relationship between Léon and Mathilda, with which American audiences were uncomfortable. This, however, is not entirely accurate. When the film was first test screened in Los Angeles, the only scene that the audience reacted to was the scene where Mathilda propositions Léon, and he rejects her. The audience responded with nervous laughter, and Besson was pressured to remove the scene. However, this is the only scene which was cut. In 2000, in an interview with Richard Jobson of the Manchester Guardian, Besson stated, \"I was happy with the first one, it was mine, my director's cut, no one asked me to cut it.\" He also explains why he made the extended cut for the first time in 1996; At the same time you still have 25 minutes that nobody has seen. I think it was the beginning of the summer; in the summer France is like a desert, the people are on the beach, but there are some poor guys who stay in the cities to work, so we decided to make a long version, an extended version, to play in a just a few theatres for the people who stayed. Besson further elaborates on why the longer version was released in Japan; So we had like five screens and people loved it and sent their friends and then the Japanese called and said: \"We want the long version, please.\" It is for this reason that the extended version tends to be called the International Cut rather than the Director's Cut."

      "question": "What was the problem with the drugs Mathilda's father was holding for Stansfield?",
      "answer": "Mathilda ()'s father (Michael Badalucco) was holding 100% pure dope for Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his men. When Stansfield came back for it, the dope was only 90% pure. Dope is usually \"cut\" and mixed with other inactive substances (such as mannitol, a crystallized milk sugar normally used as a baby laxative, salt and flour etc) as it shifts from dealer to dealer, hence why it's so hard to find any that is 100% pure. Stansfield's men determined that because their product was now only 90% pure, Mathilda's father must have stolen some and replaced it with a filler. This is later proven true when one of Stansfield's men finds the original dope hidden in a clock radio in the apartment. By doing this, her father was hoping to cheat them by giving them 90% pure drugs to sell themselves, while he would sell the bit he stole himself and pocket the money. Edit"

      "question": "Why does Leon save Mathilda's life?",
      "answer": "As part of his code of conduct, Leon's main rule is \"no women, no kids,\" and Mathilda fits both categories. He knew that she would suffer the same fate as her family at the hands of Stansfield and his men if he didn't open the door. Although he would not be the one who pulled the trigger, he would have felt responsible for her death, since he could have prevented it."
