Rashomon was the first Japanese film to receive a significant international reception; it won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1951, was given an Academy Honorary Award at the 24th Academy Awards in 1952, and is considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Rashomon effect is named after the film.\r\nPlot\r\nPrologue\r\nThe story begins in Heian era Kyoto. A woodcutter and a priest are sitting beneath the Rashōmon city gate to stay dry during a downpour. A commoner joins them to shelter from the rain, and they recount a disturbing story about an assault and murder that took place. The Woodcutter and The Priest are baffled, unable to understand how everyone involved could have given such radically different accounts of the same event.\r\nThe Woodcutter claims he found the body of a murdered samurai while looking for wood in the forest, three days earlier. He first found a woman's hat (which belonged to the samurai's wife), then a samurai cap (which belonged to The Samurai), then cut rope (which had been used to bind him), and then an amulet. Finally, he discovered The Samurai's body and fled to notify the authorities. The Priest claims he saw The Samurai traveling with his wife the same day the murder happened. Both men were summoned to testify in court, where a fellow witness presented a captured bandit, who claimed to have followed the couple after coveting the woman when he glimpsed her traveling through the forest.\r\nThe bandit's story\r\nTajōmaru, the notorious outlaw bandit, claimed that he tricked The Samurai to step off the mountain trail with him to look at a cache of ancient swords he had discovered. In a grove, he tied The Samurai to a tree, then brought The Wife there with the intention of assaulting her. Initially, she tried to defend herself with a dagger but Tajōmaru overpowered and then seduced her. The Wife, ashamed, begged Tajōmaru to duel her husband to the death, to save her from the guilt, shame, and dishonor of having been with two men. She promised to go with whichever man won the battle. Tajōmaru honorably set The Samurai free and dueled with him. They fought skillfully and fiercely, with Tajōmaru praising The Samurai's swordsmanship. In the end, Tajōmaru killed The Samurai, but then realized that The Wife had fled during the duel. At the end of his testimony, he was asked about the expensive dagger used by The Wife to defend herself. Tajōmaru claimed he had forgotten about it in the confusion after the fight, and lamented leaving it behind, as the dagger's pearl inlay made it very valuable.\r\nThe priest notes that men lie, even to themselves, because they are weak.\r\nThe Wife's story\r\nThe Wife's testimony was completely different. She claimed that Tajōmaru assaulted her, then left immediately. Once he was gone, she cut her husband free from his bonds and begged him for forgiveness. Instead, he coldly stared at her, implicitly blaming her for the assault. She begged her husband to kill her so that her honor would be restored and she would be at peace. Instead, he continued to stare at her with immense loathing. His contempt distressed her so greatly, she fainted while standing over him with the dagger in her hands. She awoke to find her husband dead, the dagger in his chest. In shock, she wandered through the forest until she came upon a pond. She attempted to drown herself, but failed.\r\nThe Commoner notes that women use their tears to hide lies, and end up fooling themselves.\r\nThe Samurai's story\r\nLastly, the court heard the testimony of The Samurai, as told through a medium. The Samurai claimed that after the assault, Tajōmaru asked The Wife to marry him. To The Samurai's great shame, his wife accepted the proposal but asked Tajōmaru to first kill her husband. Disgusted by The Wife's request, Tajōmaru grabbed her and gave The Samurai the choice to let her go or have her killed. In court, The Samurai noted that for this gesture, he was almost willing to forgive Tajōmaru. The Wife broke free and fled, with Tajōmaru giving chase. Tajōmaru failed to recapture her, gave up, and returned to set The Samurai free. Tajōmaru apologized and departed. Humiliated, The Samurai killed himself with his wife's dagger. Later, he felt someone remove the dagger from his chest, but could not tell who.\r\nThe Woodcutter's story\r\nThe Woodcutter fiercely proclaims that all three stories are falsehoods and in particular notes that The Samurai was killed by a sword, not a dagger. Catching this, The Commoner gets The Woodcutter to admit that he witnessed the assault and murder, but declined the opportunity to testify because he did not want to get involved.\r\nAccording to The Woodcutter, after the assault, Tajōmaru begged The Wife to marry him. Instead, she freed her husband, hoping that he would kill Tajōmaru. However, The Samurai refused to fight, explaining to Tajōmaru that he would not risk his life for a ruined woman. Hearing this, Tajōmaru rescinded his promise to marry The Wife and prepared to leave. The Wife criticized both men, calling them dishonorable cowards: Tajōmaru because he would not keep his promise to kill The Samurai and marry her; The Samurai because he would not kill Tajōmaru to avenge his own honor (saying a real man would kill Tajōmaru and then demand that she kill herself). The two men unwillingly fought, both clearly terrified. It was a pitiful duel, nothing like what Tajōmaru described in his testimony (even The Wife seemed to regret having provoked the battle). Ultimately, Tajōmaru won through a stroke of luck, and The Samurai was killed while begging for his life. After Tajōmaru won, The Wife fled. Tajōmaru took The Samurai's sword and limped away.\r\nEpilogue\r\nThe Woodcutter, The Priest, and The Commoner are interrupted by the sound of a crying baby. They find a baby abandoned in a basket, with a kimono and a protective amulet. The Commoner steals the kimono and amulet. The Woodcutter reproaches The Commoner for stealing from an orphaned child and attempts to stop him. The Commoner overpowers The Woodcutter, and chastises him as a hypocrite: The Commoner has correctly deduced that the true reason The Woodcutter declined to testify is because he's the one who took the valuable dagger. The Commoner leaves Rashōmon gate, claiming that all men and women are motivated only by self-interest.\r\nMeanwhile, The Priest has been attempting to soothe the baby. After The Commoner departs, The Woodcutter attempts to take the baby. The Priest violently recoils: his experiences at the trial and at Rashōmon gate have destroyed his faith in humanity. The Woodcutter explains that he intends to raise the child: he already has six of his own. This revelation recasts The Woodcutter's story and motivations, restoring The Priest's faith in humanity. As The Woodcutter prepares to leave with the child, the rain stops and the clouds part, revealing the sun.\r\nCast\r\nTakashi Shimura as Kikori, The Woodcutter\r\nMinoru Chiaki as Tabi Hōshi, The Priest\r\nKichijiro Ueda as The Commoner\r\nToshiro Mifune as Tajōmaru, The Bandit\r\nMachiko Kyō as The Wife\r\nMasayuki Mori as The Samurai\r\nNoriko Honma as Miko, The Medium\r\nDaisuke Katō as Houben, The Policeman\r\nProduction\r\nThe name of the film refers to the enormous, former city gate \"between modern-day Kyoto and Nara\", on Suzaka Avenue's end to the south.\r\nDevelopment\r\nKurosawa felt that sound cinema multiplies the complexity of a film:\r\nCinematic sound is never merely accompaniment, never merely what the sound machine caught while you took the scene. Real sound does not merely add to the images, it multiplies it.\r\nRegarding Rashomon, Kurosawa said,\r\nI like silent pictures and I always have... I wanted to restore some of this beauty. I thought of it, I remember in this way: one of the techniques of modern art is simplification, and that I must therefore simplify this film.\"\r\nAccordingly, there are only three settings in the film: Rashōmon gate, the woods, and the courtyard. The gate and the courtyard are very simply constructed and the woodland is real. This is partly due to the low budget that Kurosawa gained from Daiei.\r\nCasting\r\nWhen Kurosawa shot Rashomon, the actors and the staff lived together, a system Kurosawa found beneficial. He recalls,\r\nWe were a very small group and it was as though I was directing Rashomon every minute of the day and night. At times like this, you can talk everything over and get very close indeed.\r\nFilming\r\nThe cinematographer, Kazuo Miyagawa, contributed numerous ideas, technical skill, and expertise in support for what would be an experimental and influential approach to cinematography. For example, in one sequence, there is a series of single close-ups of the bandit, then the wife, and then the husband, which then repeats to emphasize the triangular relationship between them.\r\nThe use of contrasting shots is another example of the film techniques used in Rashomon. According to Donald Richie, the length of time of the shots of the wife and of the bandit are the same when the bandit is acting barbarically and the wife is hysterically crazy.\r\nRashomon had camera shots that were directly into the sun. Kurosawa wanted to use natural light, but it was too weak; they solved the problem by using a mirror to reflect the natural light. The result makes the strong sunlight look as though it has traveled through the branches, hitting the actors. The rain in the scenes at the gate had to be tinted with black ink because camera lenses could not capture the water pumped through the hoses.\r\nLighting\r\nRobert Altman compliments Kurosawa's use of \"dappled\" light throughout the film, which gives the characters and settings further ambiguity. In his essay \"Rashomon\", Tadao Sato suggests that the film (unusually) uses sunlight to symbolize evil and sin in the film, arguing that the wife gives in to the bandit's desires when she sees the sun. However, Professor Keiko I. McDonald opposes Sato's idea in her essay \"The Dialectic of Light and Darkness in Kurosawa's Rashomon.\" McDonald says the film conventionally uses light to symbolize \"good\" or \"reason\" and darkness to symbolize \"bad\" or \"impulse\". She interprets the scene mentioned by Sato differently, pointing out that the wife gives herself to the bandit when the sun slowly fades out. McDonald also reveals that Kurosawa was waiting for a big cloud to appear over Rashomon gate to shoot the final scene in which the woodcutter takes the abandoned baby home; Kurosawa wanted to show that there might be another dark rain any time soon, even though the sky is clear at this moment. Unfortunately, the final scene appears optimistic because it was too sunny and clear to produce the effects of an overcast sky.\r\nEditing\r\nStanley Kauffmann writes in The Impact of Rashomon that Kurosawa often shot a scene with several cameras at the same time, so that he could \"cut the film freely and splice together the pieces which have caught the action forcefully as if flying from one piece to another.\" Despite this, he also used short shots edited together that trick the audience into seeing one shot; Donald Richie says in his essay that \"there are 407 separate shots in the body of the film ... This is more than twice the number in the usual film, and yet these shots never call attention to themselves.\"\r\nMusic\r\nThe film was scored by Fumio Hayasaka, who is among the most respected of Japanese composers. At the director's request, he included a bolero during the woman's story.\r\nDue to setbacks and some lost audio, the crew took the urgent step of bringing Mifune back to the studio after filming to record another line. Recording engineer Iwao Ōtani added it to the film along with the music, using a different microphone.\r\nAllegorical and symbolic content\r\nThe film depicts the rape of a woman and the murder of her samurai husband through the widely differing accounts of four witnesses, including the bandit-rapist, the wife, the dead man (speaking through a medium), and lastly the woodcutter, the one witness who seems the most objective and least biased. The stories are mutually contradictory and even the final version may be seen as motivated by factors of ego and saving face. The actors kept approaching Kurosawa wanting to know the truth, and he claimed the point of the film was to be an exploration of multiple realities rather than an exposition of a particular truth. Later film and television use of the \"Rashomon effect\" focuses on revealing \"the truth\" in a now conventional technique that presents the final version of a story as the truth, an approach that only matches Kurosawa's film on the surface.\r\nDue to its emphasis on the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, Rashomon has been read by some as an allegory of the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II. James F. Davidson's article, \"Memory of Defeat in Japan: A Reappraisal of Rashomon\" in the December 1954 issue of the Antioch Review, is an early analysis of the World War II defeat elements. Another allegorical interpretation of the film is mentioned briefly in a 1995 article, \"Japan: An Ambivalent Nation, an Ambivalent Cinema\" by David M. Desser. Here, the film is seen as an allegory of the atomic bomb and Japanese defeat. It also briefly mentions James Goodwin's view on the influence of post-war events on the film. However, \"In a Grove\" (the short story by Akutagawa that the film is based on) was published already in 1922, so any postwar allegory would have been the result of Kurosawa's editing rather than the story about the conflicting accounts. Historian and critic David Conrad has noted that the use of rape as a plot point came at a time when American occupation authorities had recently stopped censoring Japanese media and belated accounts of rapes by occupation troops began to appear in Japanese newspapers. Moreover, Kurosawa and other filmmakers had not been allowed to make jidaigeki during the early part of the occupation, so setting a film in the distant past was a way to reassert domestic control over cinema.\r\nRelease\r\nTheatrical\r\nRashomon was released in Japan on August 24, 1950. It was released theatrically in the United States by RKO Radio Pictures with English subtitles on December 26, 1951.\r\nHome media\r\nRashomon has been released multiple times on DVD. The Criterion Collection issued a Blu-ray and DVD edition of the film based on the 2008 restoration, accompanied by a number of additional features.\r\nReception and legacy\r\nBox office\r\nThe film performed well at the domestic Japanese box office, where it was one of the top ten highest-earning films of the year. It also performed well overseas, becoming Kurosawa's first major international hit.\r\nIn the United States, the film grossed $46,808 in 2002 and $96,568 during 2009 to 2010, for a combined $143,376 in the United States between 2002 and 2010.\r\nIn Europe, the film sold 365,300 tickets in France and Spain, and 8,292 tickets in other European countries between 1996 and 2020, for a combined total of at least 373,592 tickets sold in Europe.\r\nJapanese critical responses\r\nAlthough it won two Japanese awards, most Japanese critics did not like the film. When it received positive responses in the West, Japanese critics were baffled: some decided that it was only admired there because it was \"exotic\"; others thought that it succeeded because it was more \"Western\" than most Japanese films.\r\nIn a collection of interpretations of Rashomon, Donald Richie writes that \"the confines of 'Japanese' thought could not contain the director, who thereby joined the world at large\". He also quotes Kurosawa criticizing the way the \"Japanese think too little of our own things\".\r\nInternational responses\r\nThe film appeared at the 1951 Venice Film Festival at the behest of an Italian language teacher, Giuliana Stramigioli, who had recommended it to Italian film promotion agency Unitalia Film seeking a Japanese film to screen at the festival. However, Daiei Motion Picture Company (a producer of popular features at the time) and the Japanese government had disagreed with the choice of Kurosawa's work on the grounds that it was \"not of the Japanese movie industry\" and felt that a work of Yasujirō Ozu would have been more illustrative of excellence in Japanese cinema. Despite these reservations, the film was screened at the festival.\r\nBefore it was screened at the Venice festival, the film initially drew little attention and had low expectations at the festival, as Japanese cinema was not yet taken seriously in the West at the time. But once it had been screened, Rashomon drew an overwhelmingly positive response from festival audiences, praising the originality of the film and its techniques while making many question the nature of truth. The film won both the Italian Critics Award and the Golden Lion award—introducing Western audiences, including Western directors, more noticeably to both Kurosawa's films and techniques, such as shooting directly into the sun and using mirrors to reflect sunlight onto the actor's faces.\r\nThe film was released in the United States on December 26, 1951, by RKO Radio Pictures in both subtitled and dubbed versions, and it won an Academy Honorary Award in 1952 for being \"the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1951\" (the current Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film wasn't introduced until 1956). The following year, when it was eligible for consideration in other Academy Award categories, it was nominated for Best Art Direction for a Black-and-White Film.\r\nUpon release in North America, Ed Sullivan gave the film a positive review in Hollywood Citizen-News, calling it \"an exciting evening, because the direction, the photography and the performances will jar open your eyes.\" He praised Akutagawa's original plot, Kurosawa's impactful direction and screenplay, Mifune's \"magnificent\" villainous performance, and Miyagawa's \"spellbinding\" cinematography that achieves \"visual dimensions that I've never seen in Hollywood photography\" such as being \"shot through a relentless rainstorm that heightens the mood of the somber drama.\" In the early 1960s, film historians credited Rashomon as the start of the international New Wave cinema movement, which gained popularity during the late 1950s to early 1960s.\r\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 98% of 52 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; with an average rating of 9.3/10. The site's consensus reads: \"One of legendary director Akira Kurosawa's most acclaimed films, Rashomon features an innovative narrative structure, brilliant acting, and a thoughtful exploration of reality versus perception.\" In a 1998 issue of Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston wrote:\r\nRashomon is probably familiar even to those who haven't seen it, since in movie jargon, the film's title has become synonymous with its chief narrative conceit: a story told multiple times from various points of view. There's much more than that to the film, of course. For example, the way Kurosawa uses his camera...takes this fascinating meditation on human nature closer to the style of silent film than almost anything made after the introduction of sound.\r\nFilm critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and included it in his Great Movies list.\r\nRemakes and adaptations\r\nRashomon spawned numerous remakes and adaptations across film, television and theatre. Examples include:\r\nRashomon as a play, various versions of which have been performed since the 1950s, including on Broadway in 1959 as written by Michael and Fay Kanin.\r\nAndha Naal, a 1954 Tamil flim was inspired by Roshomon\r\nValerie, a 1957 American western Inspired by Kurosawa's film.\r\nThe Outrage, a 1964 American western directed by Martin Ritt.

She awoke to find her husband dead, the dagger in his chest. In shock, she wandered through the forest until she came upon a pond. She attempted to drown herself, but failed.</p><p>The Commoner notes that women use their tears to hide lies, and end up fooling themselves.</p><h4>The Samurai's story</h4><p>Lastly, the court heard the testimony of The Samurai, as told through a medium. The Samurai claimed that after the assault, Tajōmaru asked The Wife to marry him. To The Samurai's great shame, his wife accepted the proposal but asked Tajōmaru to first kill her husband. Disgusted by The Wife's request, Tajōmaru grabbed her and gave The Samurai the choice to let her go or have her killed. In court, The Samurai noted that for this gesture, he was almost willing to forgive Tajōmaru. The Wife broke free and fled, with Tajōmaru giving chase. Tajōmaru failed to recapture her, gave up, and returned to set The Samurai free. Tajōmaru apologized and departed. Humiliated, The Samurai killed himself with his wife's dagger. Later, he felt someone remove the dagger from his chest, but could not tell who.</p><h4>The Woodcutter's story</h4><p>The Woodcutter fiercely proclaims that all three stories are falsehoods and in particular notes that The Samurai was killed by a sword, not a dagger. Catching this, The Commoner gets The Woodcutter to admit that he witnessed the assault and murder, but declined the opportunity to testify because he did not want to get involved.</p><p>According to The Woodcutter, after the assault, Tajōmaru begged The Wife to marry him. Instead, she freed her husband, hoping that he would kill Tajōmaru. However, The Samurai refused to fight, explaining to Tajōmaru that he would not risk his life for a ruined woman. Hearing this, Tajōmaru rescinded his promise to marry The Wife and prepared to leave. The Wife criticized both men, calling them dishonorable cowards: Tajōmaru because he would not keep his promise to kill The Samurai and marry her; The Samurai because he would not kill Tajōmaru to avenge his own honor (saying a real man would kill Tajōmaru and then demand that she kill herself). The two men unwillingly fought, both clearly terrified. It was a pitiful duel, nothing like what Tajōmaru described in his testimony (even The Wife seemed to regret having provoked the battle). Ultimately, Tajōmaru won through a stroke of luck, and The Samurai was killed while begging for his life. After Tajōmaru won, The Wife fled. Tajōmaru took The Samurai's sword and limped away.</p><h4>Epilogue</h4><p>The Woodcutter, The Priest, and The Commoner are interrupted by the sound of a crying baby. They find a baby abandoned in a basket, with a kimono and a protective amulet. The Commoner steals the kimono and amulet. The Woodcutter reproaches The Commoner for stealing from an orphaned child and attempts to stop him. The Commoner overpowers The Woodcutter, and chastises him as a hypocrite: The Commoner has correctly deduced that the true reason The Woodcutter declined to testify is because he's the one who took the valuable dagger. The Commoner leaves Rashōmon gate, claiming that all men and women are motivated only by self-interest.</p><p>Meanwhile, The Priest has been attempting to soothe the baby. After The Commoner departs, The Woodcutter attempts to take the baby. The Priest violently recoils: his experiences at the trial and at Rashōmon gate have destroyed his faith in humanity. The Woodcutter explains that he intends to raise the child: he already has six of his own. This revelation recasts The Woodcutter's story and motivations, restoring The Priest's faith in humanity. As The Woodcutter prepares to leave with the child, the rain stops and the clouds part, revealing the sun.</p><br/><h3>Cast</h3><ul><li>Takashi Shimura as Kikori, The Woodcutter</li><li>Minoru Chiaki as Tabi Hōshi, The Priest</li><li>Kichijiro Ueda as The Commoner</li><li>Toshiro Mifune as Tajōmaru, The Bandit</li><li>Machiko Kyō as The Wife</li><li>Masayuki Mori as The Samurai</li><li>Noriko Honma as Miko, The Medium</li><li>Daisuke Katō as Houben, The Policeman</li></ul><br/><h3>Production</h3><p>The name of the film refers to the enormous, former city gate \"between modern-day Kyoto and Nara\", on Suzaka Avenue's end to the south.</p><h4>Development</h4><p>Kurosawa felt that sound cinema multiplies the complexity of a film:</p><blockquote>Cinematic sound is never merely accompaniment, never merely what the sound machine caught while you took the scene. Real sound does not merely add to the images, it multiplies it.</blockquote><p>Regarding Rashomon, Kurosawa said,</p><blockquote>I like silent pictures and I always have... I wanted to restore some of this beauty. I thought of it, I remember in this way: one of the techniques of modern art is simplification, and that I must therefore simplify this film.\"</blockquote><p>Accordingly, there are only three settings in the film: Rashōmon gate, the woods, and the courtyard. The gate and the courtyard are very simply constructed and the woodland is real. This is partly due to the low budget that Kurosawa gained from Daiei.</p><h4>Casting</h4><p>When Kurosawa shot Rashomon, the actors and the staff lived together, a system Kurosawa found beneficial. He recalls,</p><blockquote>We were a very small group and it was as though I was directing Rashomon every minute of the day and night. At times like this, you can talk everything over and get very close indeed.</blockquote><h4>Filming</h4><p>The cinematographer, Kazuo Miyagawa, contributed numerous ideas, technical skill, and expertise in support for what would be an experimental and influential approach to cinematography. For example, in one sequence, there is a series of single close-ups of the bandit, then the wife, and then the husband, which then repeats to emphasize the triangular relationship between them.</p><p>The use of contrasting shots is another example of the film techniques used in Rashomon. According to Donald Richie, the length of time of the shots of the wife and of the bandit are the same when the bandit is acting barbarically and the wife is hysterically crazy.</p><p>Rashomon had camera shots that were directly into the sun. Kurosawa wanted to use natural light, but it was too weak; they solved the problem by using a mirror to reflect the natural light. The result makes the strong sunlight look as though it has traveled through the branches, hitting the actors. The rain in the scenes at the gate had to be tinted with black ink because camera lenses could not capture the water pumped through the hoses.</p><h4>Lighting</h4><p>Robert Altman compliments Kurosawa's use of \"dappled\" light throughout the film, which gives the characters and settings further ambiguity. In his essay \"Rashomon\", Tadao Sato suggests that the film (unusually) uses sunlight to symbolize evil and sin in the film, arguing that the wife gives in to the bandit's desires when she sees the sun. However, Professor Keiko I. McDonald opposes Sato's idea in her essay \"The Dialectic of Light and Darkness in Kurosawa's Rashomon.\" McDonald says the film conventionally uses light to symbolize \"good\" or \"reason\" and darkness to symbolize \"bad\" or \"impulse\". She interprets the scene mentioned by Sato differently, pointing out that the wife gives herself to the bandit when the sun slowly fades out. McDonald also reveals that Kurosawa was waiting for a big cloud to appear over Rashomon gate to shoot the final scene in which the woodcutter takes the abandoned baby home; Kurosawa wanted to show that there might be another dark rain any time soon, even though the sky is clear at this moment. Unfortunately, the final scene appears optimistic because it was too sunny and clear to produce the effects of an overcast sky.</p><h4>Editing</h4><p>Stanley Kauffmann writes in The Impact of Rashomon that Kurosawa often shot a scene with several cameras at the same time, so that he could \"cut the film freely and splice together the pieces which have caught the action forcefully as if flying from one piece to another.\" Despite this, he also used short shots edited together that trick the audience into seeing one shot; Donald Richie says in his essay that \"there are 407 separate shots in the body of the film ... This is more than twice the number in the usual film, and yet these shots never call attention to themselves.\"</p><h4>Music</h4><p>The film was scored by Fumio Hayasaka, who is among the most respected of Japanese composers. At the director's request, he included a bolero during the woman's story.</p><p>Due to setbacks and some lost audio, the crew took the urgent step of bringing Mifune back to the studio after filming to record another line. Recording engineer Iwao Ōtani added it to the film along with the music, using a different microphone.</p><br/><h3>Allegorical and symbolic content</h3><p>The film depicts the rape of a woman and the murder of her samurai husband through the widely differing accounts of four witnesses, including the bandit-rapist, the wife, the dead man (speaking through a medium), and lastly the woodcutter, the one witness who seems the most objective and least biased. The stories are mutually contradictory and even the final version may be seen as motivated by factors of ego and saving face. The actors kept approaching Kurosawa wanting to know the truth, and he claimed the point of the film was to be an exploration of multiple realities rather than an exposition of a particular truth. Later film and television use of the \"Rashomon effect\" focuses on revealing \"the truth\" in a now conventional technique that presents the final version of a story as the truth, an approach that only matches Kurosawa's film on the surface.</p><p>Due to its emphasis on the subjectivity of truth and the uncertainty of factual accuracy, Rashomon has been read by some as an allegory of the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II. James F. Davidson's article, \"Memory of Defeat in Japan: A Reappraisal of Rashomon\" in the December 1954 issue of the Antioch Review, is an early analysis of the World War II defeat elements. Another allegorical interpretation of the film is mentioned briefly in a 1995 article, \"Japan: An Ambivalent Nation, an Ambivalent Cinema\" by David M. Desser. Here, the film is seen as an allegory of the atomic bomb and Japanese defeat. It also briefly mentions James Goodwin's view on the influence of post-war events on the film. However, \"In a Grove\" (the short story by Akutagawa that the film is based on) was published already in 1922, so any postwar allegory would have been the result of Kurosawa's editing rather than the story about the conflicting accounts. Historian and critic David Conrad has noted that the use of rape as a plot point came at a time when American occupation authorities had recently stopped censoring Japanese media and belated accounts of rapes by occupation troops began to appear in Japanese newspapers. Moreover, Kurosawa and other filmmakers had not been allowed to make jidaigeki during the early part of the occupation, so setting a film in the distant past was a way to reassert domestic control over cinema.</p><br/><h3>Release</h3><h4>Theatrical</h4><p>Rashomon was released in Japan on August 24, 1950. It was released theatrically in the United States by RKO Radio Pictures with English subtitles on December 26, 1951.</p><h4>Home media</h4><p>Rashomon has been released multiple times on DVD. The Criterion Collection issued a Blu-ray and DVD edition of the film based on the 2008 restoration, accompanied by a number of additional features.</p><br/><h3>Reception and legacy</h3><h4>Box office</h4><p>The film performed well at the domestic Japanese box office, where it was one of the top ten highest-earning films of the year. It also performed well overseas, becoming Kurosawa's first major international hit.</p><p>In the United States, the film grossed $46,808 in 2002 and $96,568 during 2009 to 2010, for a combined $143,376 in the United States between 2002 and 2010.</p><p>In Europe, the film sold 365,300 tickets in France and Spain, and 8,292 tickets in other European countries between 1996 and 2020, for a combined total of at least 373,592 tickets sold in Europe.</p><h4>Japanese critical responses</h4><p>Although it won two Japanese awards, most Japanese critics did not like the film. When it received positive responses in the West, Japanese critics were baffled: some decided that it was only admired there because it was \"exotic\"; others thought that it succeeded because it was more \"Western\" than most Japanese films.</p><p>In a collection of interpretations of Rashomon, Donald Richie writes that \"the confines of 'Japanese' thought could not contain the director, who thereby joined the world at large\". He also quotes Kurosawa criticizing the way the \"Japanese think too little of our own things\".</p><h4>International responses</h4><p>The film appeared at the 1951 Venice Film Festival at the behest of an Italian language teacher, Giuliana Stramigioli, who had recommended it to Italian film promotion agency Unitalia Film seeking a Japanese film to screen at the festival. However, Daiei Motion Picture Company (a producer of popular features at the time) and the Japanese government had disagreed with the choice of Kurosawa's work on the grounds that it was \"not of the Japanese movie industry\" and felt that a work of Yasujirō Ozu would have been more illustrative of excellence in Japanese cinema. Despite these reservations, the film was screened at the festival.</p><p>Before it was screened at the Venice festival, the film initially drew little attention and had low expectations at the festival, as Japanese cinema was not yet taken seriously in the West at the time. But once it had been screened, Rashomon drew an overwhelmingly positive response from festival audiences, praising the originality of the film and its techniques while making many question the nature of truth. The film won both the Italian Critics Award and the Golden Lion award—introducing Western audiences, including Western directors, more noticeably to both Kurosawa's films and techniques, such as shooting directly into the sun and using mirrors to reflect sunlight onto the actor's faces.</p><p>The film was released in the United States on December 26, 1951, by RKO Radio Pictures in both subtitled and dubbed versions, and it won an Academy Honorary Award in 1952 for being \"the most outstanding foreign language film released in the United States during 1951\" (the current Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film wasn't introduced until 1956). The following year, when it was eligible for consideration in other Academy Award categories, it was nominated for Best Art Direction for a Black-and-White Film.</p><p>Upon release in North America, Ed Sullivan gave the film a positive review in Hollywood Citizen-News, calling it \"an exciting evening, because the direction, the photography and the performances will jar open your eyes.\" He praised Akutagawa's original plot, Kurosawa's impactful direction and screenplay, Mifune's \"magnificent\" villainous performance, and Miyagawa's \"spellbinding\" cinematography that achieves \"visual dimensions that I've never seen in Hollywood photography\" such as being \"shot through a relentless rainstorm that heightens the mood of the somber drama.\" In the early 1960s, film historians credited Rashomon as the start of the international New Wave cinema movement, which gained popularity during the late 1950s to early 1960s.</p><p>Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 98% of 52 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; with an average rating of 9.3/10. The site's consensus reads: \"One of legendary director Akira Kurosawa's most acclaimed films, Rashomon features an innovative narrative structure, brilliant acting, and a thoughtful exploration of reality versus perception.\" In a 1998 issue of Time Out New York, Andrew Johnston wrote:</p><blockquote>Rashomon is probably familiar even to those who haven't seen it, since in movie jargon, the film's title has become synonymous with its chief narrative conceit: a story told multiple times from various points of view. There's much more than that to the film, of course. For example, the way Kurosawa uses his camera...takes this fascinating meditation on human nature closer to the style of silent film than almost anything made after the introduction of sound.</blockquote><p>Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four and included it in his Great Movies list.</p><h4>Remakes and adaptations</h4><p>Rashomon spawned numerous remakes and adaptations across film, television and theatre. Examples include:</p><ul><li>Rashomon as a play, various versions of which have been performed since the 1950s, including on Broadway in 1959 as written by Michael and Fay Kanin.</li><li>Andha Naal, a 1954 Tamil flim was inspired by Roshomon</li><li>Valerie, a 1957 American western Inspired by Kurosawa's film.</li><li>The Outrage, a 1964 American western directed by Martin Ritt.
