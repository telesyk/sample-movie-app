This is only a short list of notable films that illustrate this very popular, perception theme. Does it all stem from Rashomon? Perhaps in the film medium, but in the literary sense this theme can be traced back thousands of years and is otherwise ancient. Either way, I believe all of the directors listed were at least aware of, if not influenced directly by Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon as it was one of the first foreign films to ever win an Academy Award."
