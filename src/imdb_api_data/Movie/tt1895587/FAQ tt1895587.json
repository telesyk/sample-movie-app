      "question": "What is \"Cardinal Law\"? Is it like the Ten Commandments? Is it normal for me to be unfamiliar with it because I am not Catholic?",
      "answer": "He is a person that holds the rank of Cardinal.. His full name is Bernard Francis Law."

    {
      "question": "What has been the Catholic media response to \"Spotlight\"?",
      "answer": "\"Spotlight\" deals with the Globe's investigation of the Catholic Church's sexual abuse cover-up, but this scandal is well-known territory by now, and the response of the Catholic media has been largely supportive of the film. Because the film chose not to sensationalize or distort, it is not easily dismissed. Read more here."

      "question": "How does \"Spotlight\" pay tribute to longform journalism?",
      "answer": "During a Q&A at the DGA Theater in New York City in 2015, Tom McCarthy said the film \"pays a lot of respect to high-end investigative reporting, specifically on a local level.\" McCarthy emphasizes the importance of maintaining a vital independent press to investigate our institutions. Some worry that the form of boots-on-the-ground, workman-like investigative reporting he triumphs is a fading art."

      "question": "When Robbie is asked why nobody has spoken up so far, he tries to answer by saying \"Good Germans?\". The retort to this is \"do you really want to make this allegation, in THIS town?\" (not verbatim, more or less). Why is Boston different from other towns in the US so the characterization \"good Germans\" is something of a taboo?",
      "answer": "First, your recollection of the retort is incorrect. Bradlee doesn't say anything about \"this town\" or imply that the \"good Germans\" analogy is especially objectionable because of Boston. Here is the exchange: Bradlee: 90 f--ing priests. In Boston? Robinson: That's what he said. Bradlee: If there were 90 of these bastards, people would know. Rezendes: Maybe they do. Bradlee: And no one said a thing? Rezendes: Good Germans? Bradlee: I don't think that's a comparison you want to make publicly.Bradlee is saying that Rezendes is essentially comparing Catholics who knew about clerical abuse and said nothing to Germans who quietly allowed Nazis to murder Jews. Bradlee thinks that is an inflammatory comparison and is warning Rezendes that if he makes that analogy, many people will see it as unfairly critical to the church. Additionally, it is generally thought of as a bad idea to compare anything to the Holocaust, since the Holocaust is considered by many historians to be sui generis."
