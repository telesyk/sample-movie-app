      "question": "Is 'Yojimbo' based on a book?",
      "answer": "Japanese film director Akira Kurosawa (1910-1998) both wrote and directed Yojimbo (English: The Bodyguard) although he has admitted to basing it on The Glass Key (1947), an adaptation of the 1931 novel of the same name by Dashiell Hammett (1894-1961). Some Kurosawa scholars argue that the inspiration was Red Harvest (1929), also by Dashiell Hammett. Both novels deal with corrupt officials and businessmen."

      "question": "Who did the man with the prayer drums kill?",
      "answer": "It's the silk merchant (you already hear his prayer drums at the beginning of the film, when Gonji does his exposition speech to the newly-arrived rônin), going after the sake merchant."

      "question": "Any recommendations for movies similar to \"Yojimbo\"?",
      "answer": "If you like this movie, try some of Akira Kurosawa's jidaigeki cinema, like , Kagemusha (1980), and Shichinin no samurai (1954) \"Seven Samurai\". The basic concept for Yojimbo (relocated to the American Wild West) was later used by Sergio Leone for his directorial debut film Per un pugno di dollari (1964).Also try Tsubaki Sanjûrô (1962) since it's a sequel to this and stars the same character. Kurosawa also returned to direct it. It's not as talked about as Yojinbo outside of Japan. Edit"
