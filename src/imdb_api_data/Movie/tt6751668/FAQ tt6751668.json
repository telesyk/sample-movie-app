      "question": "Why weren't there any cameras inside Mr. Park's house?",
      "answer": "Even people with high tech security often don't want cameras on the inside of their house, only the outside. It's also possible they do have a few cameras inside the house, such as the garage or front door, but may only check them if something was wrong."

      "question": "Why did the Kim family use English names for themselves when working for the Parks?",
      "answer": "It is very common to assume a name in the language you are studying. It also makes the Kims seem more sophisticated to the Parks, who value Western/international tutors."

    {
      "question": "How is Parasite a comedy? Apart from a couple of lines by the Mrs. Kim, I didn't find anything comedic.",
      "answer": "Comedy is a very subjective thing: what's funny for others may not be funny for you and vice versa. Also, not all humour is meant to make you laugh out loud. The absurdity of the premise and several of the situations the family finds themselves in can be considered a dark comedy."

      "question": "What's the meaning of the first and last shot being the same?",
      "answer": "Director said \"Parasite\" begins with a scene in which the sun lights up Ki-taek's filthy semi-basement home as if his family are not yet living below-the-surface lives. \"But at the same time, they are afraid of falling into a complete underground situation if they get worse,\" he said. \"This is the ingenious point my movie has\" , Nearly 90 percent of the story takes place in a big house, the home of the rich family. It has a vertical structure -- second floor, first floor and basement \" . Vertical structures typically symbolize social hierarchy in cinema, but Bong said the structures in \"Parasite\" are even more special because of indigenous subterranean residential spaces called \"semi-basements. \"In South Korea, the semi-basement has subtle nuances,\" he said. \"(People) live underground, but want to believe that they are above the ground because they have a moment when sunlight comes into their room.\" The ending is narrated from Ki-woo's perspective. Ki-woo promises that one day, he will earn enough money and buy the house so that his father can be free. The movie ends with Ki-woo waking up from a dream in which he purchases the house and the three remaining family members reunite, but the last shot which is same as the first shot indicate it's possible that their condition will not improve, indicating socio-economic barrier between classes may not change. Edit"

    {
      "question": "How was Ki-Woo going to send his letter to his father, if he was underground and had no visibility into the outside world?",
      "answer": "The ending of the movie created the impression that Ki-Woo was more or less writing that letter (with its promise to buy the house) to himself, as he would have to try hard to find a way he could deliver it to his father."

    {
      "question": "What is the meaning of that rock?",
      "answer": "That rock has multiple meanings throughout this movie. At the beginning of the movie, the rock means luck and hope to Kim Ki-woo. It represented his need to climb up the mountain to become rich, famous and successful. Towards the end of the movie, as the family loses control and situation gets worse, his dreams all crash. He was devastated and realized the rock is just a normal rock; nothing special about it. The meaning of the rock became greed, hatred, lies, impurity and poverty. The rock had turned into murder weapon. The rock eventually is returned to the river where it sits beautifully with other similar rocks, this could represent a returning to a more natural place which contrasts with the 'insanity' of the societal structures explored within the movie. Rocks also symbolize stability."

    {
      "question": "What happened to Park Da-song's notepad in which he was decoding the Morse Code? Shouldn't the police have searched the place and if it had been found, would have decoded where Kim Ki-taek was?",
      "answer": "In the notepad Da-song uses to 'decode' the morse code, the Korean alphabet written that are visible do not combine to create any letters, save for one exception, which says 'ah'. It's presumed that Geun-se intended to spell out 'Do-Wa-Jwo' which would spell out 'help'. In the English subtitles this was written as 'holp'. In any case, the message would not reveal the location of the sender."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did the father of the family kill Mr Park ?",
      "answer": "During the party, when Da Song sees his \"ghost\" again, he has another seizure. Mrs. Park had mentioned earlier in the film that you only have 15 minutes to get a child to the hospital after a seizure before there is permanent damage. After his daughter and wife are stabbed, there is now a real urgency to get the three of them (Da Song, Mrs. Kim, and Ki Yung) to the hospital. As the wealthy family, the Parks own the car and will be able to get to the hospital. Mr. Kim is stuck watching his wife and daughter in peril. All of the humiliation and rage at his status and situation finally boil over into that violent impulse against Mr. Park.Another point is that Mr. Park references the damp/moldy smell of Mr. Kim as if he were just some subterranean animal but not a human. If you see it metaphorically, you can imagine this a commentary on society's prejudice towards lower classes, or the \"smell of the lower class\". In this final scene he was again repulsed at the smell of another lower class person. Even in this dire, horrific situation where Mr. Park's son is having a seizure, a lunatic stabs his son's tutor, who is then in turn Stabbed by his maid; Mr. Park still manages to show revulsion of the lower class. Mr. Kim saw this and in that moment of rage, felt Mr. Park needed to die."

      "question": "What was Kim Ki-woo's original intention for going to the basement with the rock near the end? Did he intend to murder? Or was he bringing the rock out of comfort or a gift?",
      "answer": "While both interpretations are possible, it appears more likely that he meant it as a tribute of peace. We see his family about to bring food to their captives, and after Kim Ki-woo drops the stone and goes downstairs, he asks the Moon-gwang if she's OK instead of retrieving his would-be weapon and making sure she's dead.Alternatively, Kim Ki-Woo did plan on killing them both. His conscience weighing heavy with the thought of the deed. Feeling he needed to step up and solve the family's problems. By getting rid of Moon-Gwang and her husband, they could potentially live in the bunker instead. Seeing as how their home was flooded."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Moon Gwang (the first housekeeper) have injuries and blood on her face when she comes to visit her husband in the underground bunker ?",
      "answer": "Moon-Gwang arrives at the house, begging to be let in, she's clearly got a swollen lip and a bruised right cheek/eye. The most probable explanation is that the loan sharks after her husband had found her and smacked her around, trying to find the location of her husband.After struggling to open the bunker, she falls on her face, bruising it further."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why all the deceptions? Why not simply recommend each other as family members?",
      "answer": "The Parks are shown to be extremely sophisticated/pretentious and susceptible to social status. The Kims deduced that if they had simply recommended each other for the available positions, revealing they were related, the Parks may not have wanted to hire them - while they were eager to hire them as a famous art teacher, a former driver of a businessman and a housekeeper of an exclusive association.Also, it would have looked suspicious if the previous driver and housekeeper had suddenly lost their position only to be quickly replaced by relatives of the new servants/help. Ki-taek's allegations against the former housekeeper, in particular, would have looked *very* dubious if they had led to hiring his own wife."
    },
    {
      "question": "Wouldn't Chung-sook and Ki-woo go to jail at the end? Why are they on probation?",
      "answer": "The hidden bunker and Moon-gwang's corpse were not discovered; if the whole story had emerged Chung-sook would definitely have been charged with murder and her son would have been accessory to the crime.Without the whole story involving Moon-gwang and Geun-se (believed to be a crazy homeless man who mysteriously broke into the Parks' house), and with the murder of Dong-Ik Park committed by Ki-taek alone, Chung-sook and Ki-woo only appeared guilty of the relatively minor crime of deceiving their employers with fake identities and credentials, with all their worse deeds ignored by the law."
    },
    {
      "question": "Would the authorities have eventually determined that the man who killed the daughter at the party was the husband of the former housekeeper?",
      "answer": "The authorities would have to conduct a very thorough investigation to find out his identity because he'd been out of sight for four years and his wife presumably never reported his disappearance. But the Park family and their guests assumed he was a homeless man, and the surviving Kim family members wouldn't want any further investigation into their story, so the matter would probably be dropped."
    },
    {
      "question": "Did Mr. Kim work at the bakery that the housekeeper's husband once owned? At the buffet, there is a vague reference to working at a bakery, and we later learn that the housekeeper's husband owned the same kind of bakery. What is the connection there?",
      "answer": "It's possible, but Mr. Kim likely would have recognised the houskeeper's husband if he worked at the same bakery.More likely, it's meant to show that the housekeeper and her husband were essentially the same as the Kim family. Their business failed and they became destitute. Leading them to manipulate and maneuver themselves in to the lives of the same wealthy family."
