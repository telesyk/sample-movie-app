      "question": "How does James Norrington know Jack Sparrow's name by looking at his tattoo?",
      "answer": "Jack Sparrow is an infamous pirate, and his description has been passed around to all the naval captains (like a wanted poster that would read \"You can recognize Jack Sparrow by the tattoo of a bird on his right forearm\"). We know that he's been arrested in the past because of the \"P\" branded on his wrist right below the tattooâ€”the Navy or the East India Company probably made a thorough description of all of his distinguishing features while they had him in custody."

    {
      "question": "What does Jack's compass point to if it doesn't point North?",
      "answer": "It is explained in the next film, but the compass points to what you want most. In this film, Jack wanted the Black Pearl the most, so it was pointing to the Pearl or the Isle De Muerta."

      "question": "If blood has to be repaid to lift the curse, how come Jack didn't have to do this?",
      "answer": "He did, but it is easy to miss. Before he throws his coin to Will, he quickly cuts his hand with his own sword and smears his blood on the coin. Watch it frame-by-frame if you continue to have difficulty. Many people have."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why didn't Barbossa slit Elizabeth's throat like he was going to do with Will?",
      "answer": "There are several possible reasons: (1) Barbossa is a gentleman and it was beneath his sense of \"honor\" to kill an innocent and brave woman, (2) he took a liking to Elisabeth and did not want to hurt her, and (3) the pirates intended to use her to satisfy their \"lust\" since they had not been able to do so since the curse was forced upon them. Hence his line \"Waste not.\" (4) Barbossa simply didn't feel it was necessary to cut someone's throat to complete the ritual. Once Elisabeth's blood didn't work, Koehler suggests cutting her throat and spilling all her blood, just to make sure. But Elisabeth had already admitted that William Turner wasn't her father, so Barbossa knew it was pointless."

      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "As they read off the list of Jack's crimes piracy, smuggling, impersonating an officer of the Spanish Royal Navy, impersonating a cleric of the Church of England, sailing under false colours, arson, kidnapping, looting, poaching, brigandage, pilfering, depravity, depredation, and general lawlessness Will makes his way toward the gallows. When the hangman releases the trap door, Will tosses his sword into the hanging post just under Jack's feet, giving him a foothold until Will can get close enough to cut him down. A general riot breaks out as Jack and Will defend themselves against the British Navy. Governor Swann and Commodore Norrington () confront Will, who stands between them and Jack. When Elizabeth also joins Will in an attempt to protect Jack, the Governor orders the Army to stand down. Meanwhile, Jack has been slowly backing up until he falls off the rampart and into the water below just as the Black Pearl rounds the rocks. Norrington realizes that it is Will whom Elizabeth loves and admits his defeat by admiring the quality of Will's sword and assuring himself that \"...the man who made it would show the same care and devotion in every aspect of his life.\" When asked what to do about Jack Sparrow, Norrington replies, \"I think we can afford to give him one day's head start.\" Jack swims out to the ship and is pulled aboard by his crew. They sail off toward the horizon. In the final scene, the little capuchin monkey back in the cave takes a medallion from the box of gold and is instantly skeletonized in the moonlight, reawakening the curse. Edit"

      "question": "Why is Gibbs part of the Royal Navy and fearful of pirates at the beginning of the film but then a pirate himself later on?",
      "answer": "This is never explained in any of the movies but several theories exist. The first is that Gibbs was disgraced from the Royal Navy for one reason or another such as his constant drinking even when on Duty. The second: Gibbs yearned for a free life and quit the Navy after a few years seeing how tyrannical they were, which inspired him to become a pirate. The third: Gibbs was always secretly a pirate or sympathetic to their cause and simply acted as if against them in order to not be discovered. The fourth: Gibbs had let a pirate go free (likely Jack) from his custody, making him no longer welcome in the Navy and perhaps law-abiding society altogether. This theory is fairly likely, since likewise occurs to James Norrington in the sequel, . Norrington therein says, \"My story is exactly the same as your story, except one chapter behind.\" As we know, Norrington let Jack get a head start on his escape, which eventually lead to Norrington being ejected from the Navy and a warrant issued for his arrest, forcing him to join a pirate crew.

    {
      "question": "Why was Jack Sparrow suddenly cursed?",
      "answer": "When Sparrow says \"For instance, after you killed Norrington's men. Every. Last. One of them.\" he picks up some coins from the chest and then throws them back in. He keeps one."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why weren't Will or Elizabeth Cursed?",
      "answer": "To get cursed you have to remove the coins from the chest itself. Bootstrap Bill (Will's father) was the one who originally took the coin, thus it was he who had the curse-not Will (to whom he sent the coin) and not Elizabeth (who took it from Will after they found him floating at sea). When Elizabeth retrieved the coin back directly on the Isla de Muerta, it was Barbossa who removed it from the chest first, but he was cursed already."
    },
    {
      "question": "How come Pintel is still alive when the curse is lifted even though Barbossa shot him earlier?",
      "answer": "Barbossa is shot by Jack after the curse is lifted, The blood repaid had already occurred off screen, Jack tosses the coin to Will who, like Jack slices his hand and bleeds on the medallion repaying Bootstraps blood owed. Pintel is alive cause he was shot before the curse was lifted. Hence the dialogue of:(Jack fires his pistol at Barbossa.)Barbossa: (looks at Jack.) \"Ten years, you been carrying that pistol and you waste your shot?\"Will: \"He didn't waste it.\" (holds a bloody knife and drops Jack's coin and his dad's medallion into the chest, both smeared with blood.)"
