      "question": "It originally had the runtime at 2 hours and 39 minutes, then few days before the film was released, it was cut for 9 minutes, then another 2 minutes (now it's 2 hours and 28 minutes). Why it was cut?",
      "answer": "For pacing purposes, possibly. There were already too many characters for the story, so the scenes were left out of the movie. They will be available separately on the Blu-ray featurettes section."

    {
      "question": "Can we expect a director's cut?",
      "answer": "Marvel Studios recently revealed in the summer of 2022 (about three months since the theatrical release of No Way Home ended) that there will be an extended cut of the film that will incorporate more footage. It will premiere in theaters in September 2022 and has been confirmed by multiple sources. Also, it has officially been declared 'The More Fun Stuff Cut', a slight reference to Marvel's rival company, DC Comics, and the unofficial title of the definitive four-hour cut of Justice League: The Snyder Cut, as it features only footage shot by Zack Snyder, no Joss Whedon."

    {
      "question": "Will Dylan Baker appear as Dr. Curtis Connors and will he become the Lizard in this Spider-Man entry?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Does Bruce Campbell appear in this?",
      "answer": "Sadly, no, especially since he was supposed to wind up being Mysterio/Quentin Beck in the Sam Raimi trilogy. However, since he briefly appears in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, it raises the possibility that he may finally become Mysterio."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Anne Hathaway appear in this as the Black Cat?",

      "question": "Why don't all the duplicates of the Multiverse look identical here when in the Doctor Strange Multiverse story they do?",
      "answer": "\"infinite number of universes with an infinite number of posibilities\"That means (in example) there's an universe where Dr. Strange looks like Peter Parker and viceversa. The variants dont have to look EXACTLY like the other, the perfect example was shown in \"Loki\" (Loki, Sylvie, Classic Loki, Child, etc)"

      "question": "Why wasn't Topher Grace's Venom in this when he knew Spider-Man's identity?",
      "answer": "They hinted that people would just keep coming if they didn't stop it. They didn't say that every single person who knew was already there. The whole point was to stop the rest (as well as the infinite number of Peter Parkers in the Multiverse and the girlfiends, Uncle Bens etc)It's an easy way for them to try to avoid confusion as well as keeping the things people didn't like about the older movies out of this one."
