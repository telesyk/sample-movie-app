      "question": "What will it cost to repair all the damage to the building by the bad guys?",
      "answer": "Probably a few hundred thousand to a million dollars by 1980's standards."

    {
      "question": "What exactly is the deal with Ellis? Why was he acting so strange?",
      "answer": "Ellis was high on cocaine the entire film. John actually saw him do it in Holly's office. LA was out of his jurisdiction so John probably didn't have the authority nor the inclination to arrest him. However, he decided to tease him by saying \"you missed some\", referring to the cocaine that was still around his nose."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does McClane need to take a gun to L.A.?",
      "answer": "Any sworn member of US law enforcement is allowed to carry their firearm concealed to any jurisdiction that allows it under LEOSA, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act. Many departments encourage carry of firearm even while on vacation for officer safety. This is also mentioned in the film Beverly Hills Cop."
    },
    {
      "question": "What did Agent Johnson (the other one) mean when he said \"Just like fucking Saigon!\" on the chopper?",
      "answer": "As they were riding in a helicopter, with rifles to attack the enemy, Johnson likely was simply saying it reminded him of his service during the Vietnam war, where armed soldiers were often sent in to battle on a helicopter like the one they were flying in, a Bell UH-1 or \"Huey\", which was instrumental in combat in Vietnam."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did John's tank top go from being pure white to dark gray?",
      "answer": "Because he got quite workout, sweating in the shirt while hiding and fighting with Hans' men but also from crawling around in the air ducts, which were dusty. Even though we didn't see how dirty they were, aluminum ductwork like that gets full of dust very quickly, plus there were several floors still being constructed which would produce a lot of debris."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is 'Die Hard' about?",
      "answer": "NYC cop John McClane (), newly arrived in Los Angeles on Christmas vacation, stops to visit with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at the Nakatomi Plaza where she works. While the Nakatomi employees are reveling on the 30th floor at their company's Christmas party and John is in the bathroom freshening up, a group of heavily armed thieves pretending to be terrorists, led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), stage a siege, taking all of the employees, including Holly, as hostages, leaving John to launch a one-man war in an attempt to stop them and save the hostages.

    },
    {
      "question": "Is \"Die Hard\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "Die Hard is based on the novel Nothing Lasts Forever (1979) by American writer Roderick Thorp. The novel was adapted for the movie by American screenwriters Steven E. de Souza and Jeb Stuart. Die Hard was followed by (1990), Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995) (1995), Live Free or Die Hard (2007) (2007) and A Good Day to Die Hard (2013) (2013). Edit"

    {
      "question": "What are bearer bonds?",
      "answer": "Bearer bonds are official documents with monetary value. Normally when bonds are issued it is to a specific person or company. This is beneficial to the recipient so that if the bond is ever lost, stolen, or destroyed, it can be replaced by the issuer at no loss. Bearer bonds are not issued to anyone in particular and are therefore more like blank checks. If they are lost or stolen there is no recovery possible, as there is no record kept of the original owner. Anyone who has physical possession of a bearer bond is free to redeem it, which makes them very tempting targets for thieves. In the early 1980s, the U.S. Government made issuance of bearer bonds illegal, as their use made it much easier for drug lords and organized crime to conduct their illegal activity, hide their assets, and avoid paying their taxes.The bearer bonds in the vault in Nakatomi Tower were worth over $600 million."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Karl seem to not understand Hans talking to him in German, during the \"shooting at glass\" scene? Isn't Karl German?",
      "answer": "Yes, Karl is German. He just wonders why Hans would give him an order like that. That's why Hans repeats the order aloud after Karl hesitates, and he does so in English so the audience could understand-making the moment a bit more dramatic. While they were locked in the gunfight with McClane, Karl probably didn't know that John didn't have any boots or footwear on his feet, which is why Hans gives him the order: covering the floor with broken glass might prevent John from escaping.Another possibility is that Karl did not realize immediately what his order was, i.e., the gunfire and shattering glass either distracted Karl or it prevented him from being able to clearly hear Hans."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the origin of \"Yippee ki-yay\"?",
      "answer": "When Hans asks John if he was a child who thought of himself as John Wayne, Rambo, or Marshall Dillon, John replies, \"I was always partial to Roy Rogers actually\". Hans then says, \"Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr Cowboy?\" to which John responds with \"Yippee ki-yay!\" The reference is to a song on Roy Rogers' TV show about being a cowboy. The chorus is expressed something like \"Yippee-ki-yay..ki-yay, yippee ki-yo, he's the toughest critter west of the Alamo.\""
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of handgun does John McClane use in the movie?",
      "answer": "The Beretta 92F, a common handgun also used by the US Armed Forces since 1985. This was never issued to the NYPD, so McClane must have bought it privately and then registered it in his precinct to be his official sidearm. He continues using the Beretta in the next two Die Hard films and changes to a SIG Sauer P220R for Live Free or Die Hard."
    },
    {
      "question": "What guns do the terrorists use?",
      "answer": "Hans uses a Heckler and Koch P7 pistol whilst Karl uses a Walther PPK with a suppressor (silencer). Heinrich uses the same firearm as McClane, a Beretta 92F pistol (which is presumably where McClane gets his spare magazines from after killing him). All the other terrorists use Heckler and Koch MP5 submachineguns except for Karl who uses the futuristic looking Steyr AUG assault rifle. James uses a recoilless rifle against the police armoured vehicle and an M60 machine gun to shoot up Powell's car and take out the spotlights. They also use C4 plastic explosives and Karl makes use of stun grenades (the little hockey puck-like things he slides on the floor). Most of their weapons are of German origin like the terrorists themselves."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the differences between the theatrical cut and the extended cut?",
      "answer": "The Extended Special Edition runs approximately 62 seconds longer and includes a further plot scene. As a result, some minor plotholes disappear."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can \"Die Hard\" be considered a Christmas movie?",
      "answer": "While not originally released at Christmas, it does indeed take place at Christmas and has very a Christmas-themed score. So while the debate has raged on for over 30 years since the movie released, the bottom line is; if you consider it a Christmas movie - it is. If you don't consider it a Christmas movie - it isn't. Don't worry about other people's opinions. Just enjoy the movie whenever you choose to watch it."

      "question": "How does Holly have access to the vault but Takagi does not?",
      "answer": "Holly didn't. Takagi explains that he only knew the code for one of the vault locks. The rest required additional authorisation from Tokyo. It's possible Takagi was lying. Regardless, it cost him his life. Theo managed to crack through most of the vault doors himself, but the final vault required a code, or as was the backup plan, having the FBI cut power to the building which released the timelock on the door. Holly had absolutely no hand in accessing the vault."
    },
    {
      "question": "How could the roof job -- wiring it to explode -- be completed if Heinrich was killed?",
      "answer": "Heinrich wasn't the only guy in the crew who could do the job. After Hans and Karl retrieve the bag of explosives and detonators McClane stole and later dropped, Hans throws the bag to Uli (Al Leong, famous for playing henchmen in 80s actions flicks) and orders him to finish the job.Hans is very intelligent and crafty and would have put together a team of men with multiple skills. One of the most important types he needed were guys who can wire explosives so he had at least two of them on the team for just such an occurrence like Heinrich being killed. Uli was the backup and he finished the job."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did McClane shoot at Powell's car?",
      "answer": "He didn't. McClane smashed a window and threw Marco's body onto Powell's car to get his attention. Once that had happened, it was obvious the jig was up. So one of the terrorists started firing at Powell with an M60 machine gun, possibly in an attempt to kill him before he could radio in the situation.Due to the way it's filmed, viewers often mistake McClane as the one doing the shooting."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who are the \"terrorists\"?",
      "answer": "Actually, the villains are not terrorists but rather simply robbers who are posing as terrorists as part of their scheme to manipulate the authorities for their real apolitical goal. There are 13 of these \"terrorists\", and they are led by the former German terrorist Hans Gruber. Hans' second-in-command is compatriot Karl (), whose brother Tony (Andreas Wisniewski) is also involved. There are two Americans: Eddie (Dennis Hayden), who impersonates a security guard in the lobby, and Theo (Clarence Gilyard Jr.), the computer whiz kid. Theo is assisted in cracking the vault by Kristoffe (Gérard Bonn), who appears to be French. The missile team is made up of marksman Alexander (Joseph Plewa) and loader James (Wilhelm von Homburg). Heinrich (Gary Roberts) is tasked with rigging the explosives on the roof, a job he undertakes with Uli (Al Leong) and Marco (Lorenzo Caccialanza). Finally there is Fritz (Hans Buhringer) and Franco (Bruno Doyon), who each carry out a wide range of jobs during the heist. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "What do the terrorists want?",
      "answer": "They want the bearer bonds worth $640 million that are locked in the Nakatomi vault. After adjusting for inflation that amount would be equivalent to $1.409 billion in 2020 dollars."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did Hans know that those kids on TV were Holly McClane's?",
      "answer": "Holly told Hans that she wasn't married, but he can clearly see the pictures of her children on the desk. When he sees the same children on TV talking about their mother and father, he looks at Holly and sees her reaction, which prompts him to lift the face-down picture, whereupon he sees Holly and John side-by-side posing with their kids. Primarily, Hans is incredibly intelligent & intuitive and was able to put two and two together."
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the terrorists' plan for escaping a completely surrounded building?",
      "answer": "It is never explicitly mentioned by any of the terrorists how they plan to get away with the money while the area is full of policemen and FBI agents. Hans only says at one point: \"when you steal 600 million, they will find you, unless they think you're already dead.\" Later, one of his demands is for helicopters, suggesting that he wants to fly out of the building to a safe destination. However, he then confides to his henchmen that he intends to blow up the roof, together with the helicopters and hostages, in an attempt to confuse the authorities into thinking that everybody died in the explosion. At the end, we see Theo, Hans' computer hacker, driving an ambulance out of the terrorists' truck while wearing a paramedic's uniform. So it seems that the terrorists were planning to fake their own deaths by killing everyone, hoping that they could escape with an ambulance while posing as paramedics in the ensuing chaos. They would have escaped to a safe place long before the authorities discovered that the terrorists weren't among the dead bodies."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does McClane know to give Gruber an unloaded firearm?",
      "answer": "The \"real\" reason, according to screenwriter Steven E. De Souza, is that the terrorists were supposed to be shown wearing and synchronizing the same type of watch in the beginning of the movie. After killing a couple of terrorists, John McClane started to notice the watches, so when Hans handed John a cigarette, John saw the watch on Hans' wrist, which tipped him off. However, due to some script changes during the shooting of the movie, the scene of the terrorists synchronizing their watches was dropped, leaving this clue unaddressed to the viewer. That, of course, does not rule out that John still identified Hans as one of the terrorists by his watch. Another logical explanation is that John simply recognized Gruber's voice. John was hiding on the roof of the elevator in the beginning, where he could hear Gruber's distinct voice quite well, and later he had several conversations with him over the radio. And even if John did not recognize the voice, he may have just been overly careful, since giving a gun to a stranger in this sort of situation is after all very risky. Gruber's pseudonym of Bill Clay appearing on the staff board is a reason to trust him, although there are a few subtle reasons to raise suspicion. Even if Gruber was actually an escaped hostage, John may have expected him to hide somewhere, instead of wandering around. John may have been observing for a moment as Hans was checking on the explosives, which is certainly suspicious behavior, before approaching him. John probably knew from the beginning that Hans was one of the hostage takers but decided to humor him to see how Hans would try to trick him. The gun may have been a bluff on John's part to confirm his suspicions of \"Bill Clay\". John may have been certain or at least highly suspicious of him, so giving him a gun and turning his back would be a sure-fire way to confirm whether he was actually dealing with \"Bill\" or \"Hans\"."

      "question": "How do the terrorists die?",
      "answer": "Tony has his neck broken by McClane during the struggle when the two fall down a flight of stairs.McClane shoots the majority of the terrorists thusly: Uli is shot several times in the chest on the roof. Marco gets shot in the legs, groin and possibly the head through the table. Eddie is shot in the head. Fritz gets shot while exiting the elevator. Franco gets shot in the knees as he runs towards McClane and lands head-first through a glass window, appearing to impale himself in the throat. Heinrich tries to get the drop on McClane and is shot in the chest.James and Alexander are blown up by McClane as they operate the missile launcher.Hans is shot in the shoulder by McClane then dropped to his death from the 30th floor.Karl is shot 5 times in the chest and torso by Powell."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do any of the terrorists live?",
      "answer": "Theo is knocked unconscious by Argyle.Kristoff is simply knocked out cold by John McClane just before his final confrontation with Hans and Eddie as he is taking a box of bonds towards the exit, John knocks him down, and Kristoff is never seen again.Presumably, both are captured by the police afterwards. Robinson is heard instructing his men to sweep the building in order to check if there are any more terrorists left."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did McClane know the C4 would explode on the floor that Hans' men using the rocket launcher were on?",
      "answer": "He didn't, however, he did know that the elevator car they used was stopped at that floor. All he had to do was insert the detonator and let the chair with the C4 & computer monitor strapped to it hit the elevator car and explode."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who did McClane drop on to Powell's squad car?",
      "answer": "Marco, the guy McClane shoots through the table."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "When the helicopters arrive, Gruber ushers all of the hostages up to the roof, which the terrorists have rigged with explosives. Taking Holly with him, Gruber then goes down to the vault to get the bonds. McClane climbs up to the roof and warns the hostages that they're going to be killed if they stay there, shooting his gun into the air to scare them, so everyone starts going downstairs. Unfortunately, the FBI helicopter mistakes McClane for one of the terrorists and starts shooting at him. Suddenly the roof explodes in flames, taking out the helicopter as well. McClane gets off the roof by tying himself to a firehose and jumping off the building. He then breaks the glass in a window and swings himself inside. He meets up with Gruber who is holding a gun to Holly's head. Gruber orders McClane to put down his gun, which he does, but when Gruber thinks that he's in control of the situation, McClane whips out a gun that he had taped to his back, shoots one of the remaining terrorists and wounding Gruber. Gruber falls backwards and out of a window, almost taking Holly with him. McClane releases Holly's wristwatch (to which Gruber was clinging), and Gruber falls to his death. Meanwhile, Argyle () crashes his limo into Theo's van (it's disguised as an ambulance), preventing him from getting away with the bonds. McClane and Holly leave the building together, and McClane and Officer Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) meet face-to-face for the first time. Karl comes out of the building armed with a gun. When he takes aim at McClane, Powell shoots Karl. Thornburg (William Atherton) attempts to interview McClane, but Holly punches him in the nose. Argyle comes crashing through the garage door in his limo and drives McClane and Holly away. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why exactly did Holly punch the TV reporter Dick Thornberg at the end?",
      "answer": "Going to Holly's house to interview the children on TV was an invasion of her family's privacy and would reveal to the terrorists that Holly had children and possibly where they were located. This would then give the terrorists the opportunity to find them and kill or kidnap them -- at least, that's the reason she gives in the second movie. Also, Dick threatened Holly's babysitter (or nanny) with contacting the INS (Immigration & Naturalization Service) to gain entry to the house as well -- VERY unethical for a news reporter. On the other hand, Dick's actions caused Gruber to take Holly hostage and made the situation more difficult and dangerous for John by giving Hans that much leverage. The daughter also answers Dick's question,\"is there something you would like to say to them (parents) if they're watching?\" This tells Gruber that Holly's husband is also there at the tower and that he is likely John McClane, which is why he turns over the picture to verify it. Thus, Dick also endangers Holly and John, giving Gruber the leverage he needs to take care of McClane."
