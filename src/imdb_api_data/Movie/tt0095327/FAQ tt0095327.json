      "question": "What's in the box that Seita carries with him?",
      "answer": "The square wooden box that Seita carries with him contains his mother's ashes. Sadly, since it was a mass cremation, the ashes that Seita obtained are not, strictly speaking, \"his mother's ashes\". Rather, they are what may or may not contain some of her ashes."
