      "question": "What is Logan about?",
      "answer": "The last of the X-Men, an aging James \"Logan\" Howitt () and his dying longtime friend and mentor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) become the protectors of Laura Kinney (Dafne Keen), an 11-year-old mutant girl from the corrupt Alkali-Transigen corporation. When they discover the corporation is using mutant DNA samples to create and control mutants and use them as weapons and that the corporation also created Laura from Logan's mutant DNA, they set out to take Laura to Eden, a refuge for mutants, and Logan makes his final stand as he fights Alkali-Transigen that are after Laura and other mutant children that they created.

      "question": "Is \"Logan\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "While this film's story pulls inspiration and story ideas from several Wolverine comic book stories, the film itself is not an adaptation of any particular previously-published story. The story most noted for inspiring this film is Mark Millar's 2008 \"Old Man Logan\" mini-series. However, the final film bears no resemblance to that comic book except for minor thematic parallels."

    {
      "question": "Is this going to be Patrick Stewart's last portrayal of Charles Xavier?",
      "answer": "Patrick Stewart has also said in multiple interviews that this would be the most satisfying ending for his portrayal of Charles Xavier. However, Stewart seems generally more open to returning for small cameos than Jackman. Stewart has particularly said that he is not against making an appearance in a Deadpool sequel or episode of Legion, but the idea and offer would have to make sense for him."

      "question": "How does this film fit into the \"X-Men\" timeline?",
      "answer": "Logan is set in 2029, which is six years after the future setting of X-Men: Days of Future Past. Before the film's release, director James Mangold stated in interviews that the story takes place after the \"good\" future seen at the end of X-Men: Days of Future Past. However, fans have debated this idea from the announcement of the film and continue to debate it after its release, since some key continuity does not match perfectly between Logan and Days of Future Past, even when considering the theoretical time travel elements presented in the earlier film.Given the hints present in Logan, it's been suggested that this film takes place in continuity after X-Men and X2: X-Men United (2003) but ignores any other films in the series. Hints to this include that the original X-Men film is referenced the most; Logan also says, \"There haven't been any new mutants born in 25 years.\" The original X-Men was said to take place around 2004-2005. If Logan takes place in 2029, that means that the pathogen that caused no new mutants to be born was released shortly after the events of these films.Given that Dr. Rice, Pierce and the Reaver team are employed by Alkali research, it's possible that the pathogen was released when the Alkali base was destroyed and got into the water supply. It's possible that this can be set after the events of the \"good\" ending of Days of Future Past. Sure, the movie is set in 2029, Logan said that a new mutant hadn't been born in 25 years, and the ending of X-Men: Days of Future Past depicts many kids at the Xavier school. But it's possible that those kids weren't mutants. In X-Men: Apocalypse, Xavier said he planned to make the school open to mutants and humans, so that could be one way to explain Logan being a followup to Days of Future Past.Logan might also take place in another universe since Hugh Jackman was announced to be returning as Wolverine in the third installment of the Deadpool series."
