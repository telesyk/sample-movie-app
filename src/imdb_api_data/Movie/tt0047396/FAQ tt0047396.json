      "question": "Why was Jeff so resistant to marrying Lisa?",
      "answer": "Jeff was previously a photographer who worked in battlezones during World War II and often lived in the unfavorable conditions he described to Lisa during their first argument. He may have felt that Lisa was too delicate to accept such a lifestyle or to join him in traveling around the world. It's quite a presumptuous theory of Jeff's, especially when she proves to him that she's courageous and daring when she drops the note off to Thorwald and when she climbs the fire escape and enters Thorwald's apartment uninvited. Shortly after she returns after delivering the note and narrowly escaping detection by Thorwald, Jeff has an excited smile on his face that tells us he's beginning to understand Lisa and that she can share his adventurous life."

His door slowly opens to reveal Thorwald who asks Jeff what he wants. Jeff doesn't answer, so Thorwald begins advancing on him. Jeff repeatedly sets off the camera flash, blinding him, but Thorwald is only slowed, not stopped. He pulls Jeff out of his wheelchair and pushes him out the window. Hanging on to the sill for dear life, Jeff screams for Lisa and the police, who have just arrived at Thorwald's apartment. Luckily, the police are able to break Jeff's fall, and Thorwald confesses to his wife's murder. In the final scene, the camera sweeps the courtyard revealing the fates of the dwellers. Miss Lonelyhearts (Judith Evelyn) has made contact with the songwriter (Ross Bagdasarian) and is expressing her appreciation for his music. The woman on the fire escape (Sara Berner) is basket-training a new puppy. Miss Torso (Georgine Darcy) welcomes home her army boyfriend. Jeff, now with two broken legs, sleeps in his wheelchair while Lisa lounges nearby, reading a fashion magazine. Edit"
