      "question": "Why do Dr Chilton and Barney make a point of telling Clarice not to touch or approach the glass housing Dr Lecter? Wouldn't she be perfectly safe since he obviously can't reach her?",
      "answer": "Indeed, it would seem that the thick glass at the front of Lecter's cell would fully protect his visitors, however there's a more hidden meaning to the warning: Lecter can still strike at people from behind the glass, frightening them and causing them to recoil in shock. Such an action from the doctor could serve his need to control people, even from behind the glass. It could also cause them to experience mild PTSD: imagine a man as scary and notorious as Lecter trying to attack you. It would be an experience that could haunt you and perhaps one that would linger for a long time in your head. We see Clarice break that rule in her first meeting with Lecter when he calls her back after Miggs flings his semen at her; she walks right up to the glass. Also, inmates can be extremely inventive. They can create projectile weapons out of items found in their cells. With someone as brilliant as Lecter, he could likely fashion weapons out of most anything. Hence the extreme precautions.In the novel, Lecter's cell is designed differently; instead of a glass wall, the front consists of thick bars. Behind the bars, at a distance of several feet, was a nylon net covering the entire front of the cell."

    {
      "question": "Why does Dr. Lecter think the guy ejaculating in his hand throwing the result in Clarice's face crosses a line while he would do much more awful things to people himself?",
      "answer": "It is implied several times throughout the movie that Lecter prioritizes on attacking those who he believes have wronged him or showed discontent with him, no matter how small these misdemeanors may have been. Using this analysis, in the Silence of the Lambs, it is clear that Lecter perhaps only attacked those he did for a very good reason, no matter how twisted, that provided justification in his mind.This behavior is in stark contrast to the behavior of Miggs, who shows initial hostility against Clarice for no apparent reason, and simply treats her as an object to be humiliated and desecrated at will. Lecter takes the time to actually get to know Clarice, analyzing her behaviors and limits, to determine how he should treat her in the future. He does not show hatred to her outright at all, especially when he is introduced to her.Therefore, however evil Lecter may be as a serial killer and a cannibal, it is common knowledge that he shows explicit manners towards all first-time strangers. Many criminals take advantage of those who are nice and courteous, seeing these virtues as weakness, while Lecter viewed them as red flags that would be rude to eat as human meals. This shows a very high-class set of behavioral standards on Lecter's behalf, and it additionally gives input into how high-functioning he is for an individual detained in a mental asylum. He is vastly different to the rest of his fellow inmates, despite being just as dangerous as they are.Naturally, it would be impossible to anticipate what Lecter would have truly done had he been bodily freed around individuals he \"respected\" like Clarice and his orderly Barney, but this gives the suspension of disbelief about a false sense of morality, even though he has no conscience.Lecter viewed his own acts as just and fair: he viewed Miggs despicable actions as hedonistic and serving no particular purpose. Although this sort of conclusion may be biased towards his own perspective, we must note that Lecter is the only one who treats Clarice in any remotely human way on his prison block. This does not mean Lecter is a moral role model in any way, of course, he is still the very evil criminal he is - but his actions show a sense of refined control and very twisted reason, but reason nonetheless, compared to his neighboring prisoner's impulsive and inconsiderate ways, which he considered spiteful and cringe-worthy. Miggs had done so to Clarice for no particular reason other than to show antagonism towards her, and this sets Lecter off because his intellectual capacity could not come to terms with such a primitive way of operating."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can someone actually swallow their tongue like Miggs did?",
      "answer": "Not in the conventional sense, no, but it is highly probable that Hannibal drove Miggs so insane that the man bit through his own tongue before either accidentally swallowing it or being swayed into swallowing it. That would be the only plausible way for that statement in the movie, as said by Jack Crawford, to make any sense."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did Crawford and his team reach the mansion where Starling found Gumb and Catherine so quickly given they had flown miles to a completely different location?",
      "answer": "Movie magic. Time and distance are different in movies, as necessitated by the limits on the length of a movie due to cost. Shortcuts are taken, hoping they aren't so glaringly obvious as to derail the suspense of the film."

      "question": "What is \"The Silence of the Lambs\" about?",
      "answer": "When Catherine Martin (), the daughter of Tennessee Senator Ruth Martin (Diane Baker), is kidnapped by a serial killer known only as Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), F.B.I. agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) is called upon to interact with psychopathic, cannibalistic killer psychiatrist Doctor Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) who may have insights into the identity of Buffalo Bill.

    {
      "question": "Is \"The Silence of the Lambs\" based on a book?",
      "answer": "The movie is based on The Silence of the Lambs, a 1988 novel by American writer . The novel was adapted for the movie by American screenwriter Ted Tally. The Silence of the Lambs won the 1992 Academy Award for Best Motion Picture. There have since been two movie sequels, Hannibal (2001) and Hannibal Rising (2007) and one prequel Red Dragon (2002), also based on novels by Thomas Harris. Prior to The Silence of the Lambs, there was another Hannibal Lecter movie, Manhunter (1986), which was based on Harris' 1981 novel, Red Dragon. Edit"

      "question": "What does the title mean?",
      "answer": "Clarice tells Lecter how she was orphaned at 10 years of age and sent to live on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. One night she awoke to a terrible screaming and discovered the rancher was slaughtering the spring lambs. She grabbed a lamb and tried to rescue it. When she was found the next day, the rancher sent her away to live in an orphanage. The experience had a traumatic psychological effect on Clarice that haunts her for life. Lecter concludes that Clarice's fervent desire to save Catherine Martin will ultimately help her to silence the sound of the lambs screaming in her mind."
    },
    {
      "question": "When does the story take place?",
      "answer": "A picture of one of Buffalo Bill's victims has the year 1989 on it, so it must be either 1989 or the beginning of 1990. This is also implied when Chilton mentions the date of Hannibal's attack on a nurse (July 8th, 1981), and his remark that Hannibal has not seen a woman in 8 years. This presumes that the nurse was indeed the last woman Hannibal came into contact with, which is a reasonable assumption, given that Hannibal was locked up in a dungeon with only male orderlies."

    {
      "question": "What does \"quid pro quo\" mean?",
      "answer": "Quid pro quo is Latin for \"what for what\" or \"something for something.\" It refers to a reciprocal exchange. In the context of the movie, Lecter promises to feed information about Buffalo Bill to Clarice but only if she will tell him things about herself in return."

    {
      "question": "What kind of moths was Buffalo Bill raising?",
      "answer": "Roden () and Dr Pilcher (Paul Lazar) identify the one taken from the victim's throat as a Death's-Head moth (Acherontia styx), a species found only in Asia. In reality, the cocoon was made from Tootsie-Rolls and gummy bears, in case the actress swallowed it. Edit"

    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Lecter make such a point of telling Starling about the census taker he ate?",
      "answer": "The infamous line where Lecter tells Starling that he ate a census taker's liver with fava beans and a \"nice Chianti\" has a few meanings: On the one hand, it's a grotesque display of power. By mentioning that he did something like this to Starling, he's reminding her of what he is and, more so, of what he's capable of and how he regards selected people or people in general. On the other hand, apart from containing alcohol, a Chianti is likely to be rich in tyramineâ€”especially the more so when aged, whereas fava beans also contain a considerable amount of tyramine. Liver that is usually eaten from animals can also be high in tyramine. For obvious reasons, less is known about how a human liver differs in its constituents from that of an animal in regards to diet, potential poisoning and specific interactions. This may either be mere coincidence, simply reflect Hannibal's cannibalistic taste, or could possibly be an attempt to confuse, mock or provoke students of psychiatry or the psychology of criminalistic behavior, such as Clarice. Anything beyond that is speculative and elusive to investigations, as is probably intended, considering the context and the manner in which the statement was made as well as the nature of the individual from which it came."

      "question": "What is the building from which Lecter escapes?",
      "answer": "Contrary to how the movie portrayed it, the building he escapes from is Pittsburgh's Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum, not a Memphis courthouse."
    },
    {
      "question": "How was Hannibal able to use the pen tip as a key for the handcuffs?",
      "answer": "Often in film, when a prisoner escapes from handcuffs without a key, a small, thin metal object is used. Until the release of this film, it'd been done many times by other characters in other movies. So it wasn't too hard for the writers to convince us that Hannibal could do the same thing. Also, he's an inventive genius, which makes it even more believable. In ' novel, the escape is almost exactly the same. Hannibal does steal a pen, though it wasn't Chilton's, it belonged to an attendant who had carelessly left it behind. Hannibal spends weeks cutting the shaft of the ink cartridge using only a small burr on a bolt that holds his bunk bed against the wall of his cell. When he has a length of the shaft cut to the right size, he cuts 2 small grooves in it lengthwise. He hides it in his cheek, and a scan with a metal detecting wand misses it -- the security staffer hears a slight beep but assumes it may have been caused by Lecter's metal tooth fillings. In his new cell, while guarded by Pembry and Boyle, he uses the pen tip to bend the section of the shaft outward, making a key that he uses to undo the cuffs. The movie makes the scene a bit simpler, probably to save time and control the pacing. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "How could Hannibal possibly overpower both Pembry and Boyle? It was two armed men against one prisoner.",
      "answer": "Aside from the obvious answers like Hannibal undoing his cuffs with a piece of the pen he stole from Chilton, the bigger issue is that Boyle and Pembry didn't have the kind of respect for Hannibal's inventive genius that Barney did at the institution in Baltimore. Essentially, they considered Hannibal to be merely a prisoner to babysit. Hannibal's plan from the beginning was to get himself transferred away from Chilton (who he considered a tormentor). If you watch the beginning of the escape scene, you can easily see the mistakes Boyle and Pembry make: Boyle puts the tray on the floor near Hannibal when he rolls up the sketches (with the sketches placed on the table that Hannibal eats from, this may have also been part of Hannibal's plan; Boyle probably should've handed the tray to Pembry.) Pembry, when removing the key from the lock, is standing around much too casually, not watching Hannibal closely enough, and even turns his back on him and begins to walk out of the cage.) Additionally, Boyle probably should not have been allowed to carry a pocket knife as a personal item when working with so dangerous a prisoner. In the end, Hannibal, over the course of a few days or so that he was incarcerated in Memphis, had ample enough time to observe both men and to discern the weaknesses in their procedures.In the novel, it's explained in detail that Barney \"never forgot what he was dealing with\" in terms of his relationship with Lecter. Barney had probably been working as an orderly with mental patients for years, even before Lecter was incarcerated at his facility, so Barney probably had years of experience dealing with clever inmates like Lecter. Also in the novel, Barney allows Lecter to look at Clarice's FBI identity card up close. Before she gives it to him through the sliding meal drawer, Barney states in no uncertain terms that if Hannibal tries anything or won't return the card, he'll be punished; he'll be bound in his cell and he'll have \"dignity pants, changed twice a day\". Barney is saying that the doctor will be treated with a measured amount of indignity, which would upset the cultured and sophisticated Lecter; he'd be immobilized, unable to read, write or sketch and be forced to relieve himself uncomfortably in adult diapers. The scene in the novel serves to explain to the reader exactly how sharp Barney is when dealing with someone as dangerous as Lecter."

    {
      "question": "Is Hannibal Lecter sociopathic, psychopathic, or something else?",
      "answer": "In the novel Red Dragon, Will Graham calls Lecter a \"pure sociopath,\" but makes a point in mentioning that he only calls him this because a more appropriate term doesn't exist, meaning Lecter doesn't actually fit any psychological profile. This is echoed in the film version of The Silence of the Lambs, where Dr. Chilton refers to Lecter as a \"pure psychopath,\" but given Chilton's incompetence, it makes sense that he would term Lecter's pathology so simply. Another reference to Graham's description in Red Dragon is made when Clarice tells a young security guard in the Tennessee asylum that \"they don't have a name\" for what Lecter is. According to the film's director, , Lecter is a good man trapped in an insane mind. Anthony Hopkins plays him as a refined, eloquent and seductive character who is very careful and cunning in his crimes. This is more in line with a sociopathic pathology, as sociopaths are known to be more organized in their actions. If you consider the prequel novel Hannibal Rising to be canon (which many fans of the Lecter mythology don't), it is suggested that Hannibal's pathology is a result of irreparable trauma he suffered as a child; however, others contest this simple summary of the novel, and maintain that Lecter's childhood trauma is merely one, if not the main event that causes his already sociopathic tendencies to manifest themselves at a young age; this is suggested by Hannibal continuing to murder people, even after dealing with the people responsible for the trauma. In other words, Lecter would have become a serial killer anyway, but events from his childhood simply accelerated the process and provided him with a special focus. Some viewers even maintain that Lecter isn't actually insane at all but does horrific things simply because he wants to and is smart enough to get away with them. They maintain that the people in the novels and films refer to Lecter as insane simply because it's easier to term him as such; it gives them a false sense of security and makes them feel that they know how Lecter's mind works when they actually have no idea. Simply put, it's possible that Lecter is a sociopath or a psychopath but, considering Graham's description, it's much more likely that Lecter is just pure evil. Edit"

    {
      "question": "Why does Hannibal treat Barney Matthews so well?",
      "answer": "Over the years that Hannibal is incarcerated, Barney develops respect for Lecter's ingenuity and intelligence, not to mention, respects how dangerous Lecter is. Lecter develops respect for Barney's courteous and kind manner, and in the sequel, Barney points out that he never felt in danger after Lecter's jailbreak, as Lecter preferred to eat \"the rude\". In the novel, Lecter and Barney have a short exchange before Lecter is transferred: Lecter thanks Barney for being decent to him, and Barney accepts and wishes him well."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this film a sequel to \"Manhunter\"?",
      "answer": "It's adapted from the sequel to 's source material: novels, on both counts. There are two schools of thought on this nevertheless. One could certainly argue that The Silence of the Lambs is a sequel to Manhunter, since it features three of the same characters from Manhunter, that is, Hannibal Lecter, Jack Crawford, and Dr. Frederick Chilton (played respectively by Brian Cox, Dennis Farina, and Benjamin Hendrickson in Manhunter and Anthony Hopkins, Scott Glenn, and Anthony Heald in The Silence of the Lambs). On the other hand, Manhunter was not a successful film, which is why Dino De Laurentiis chose not to produce this film. When The Silence of the Lambs was released, it was not marketed as a sequel to Manhunter. All references from the book that mention Will \"the Red Dragon\" Graham have been excised from the film. The two returning cast members, Frankie Faison and Dan Butler, play different roles. It's also worth noting that in early drafts, when the producers were not sure if they could use the characters from Manhunter, Ted Tally changed those characters' names to cut all ties with Manhunter. They were eventually changed back. However, given that Tally also wrote the screenplay for Red Dragon (2002), which featured three out of four actors returning to their roles, including Faison playing his Silence role, it is more likely that Manhunter is meant to be part of a separate continuity, while Red Dragon is meant to be a direct prequel to The Silence of the Lambs.

      "question": "What are the differences between the theatrical cut and the workprint?",
      "answer": "There are some differences between the workprint version and the theatrical release. The workprint is more or less a final cut of the movie. Beside many minor changes, here and there are some scenes, which were removed in the theatrical version. The image quality of the workprint is especially in dark scenes pretty bad. The workprint has an alternate soundtrack. In some parts, there is no or different music and in other parts the same music compared to the theatrical version. For example, at the beginning when Starling runs through the woods, the workprint features a different dark/haunting music with a musical box motive. Furthermore all the credits and the location names are missing in the workprint."

      "question": "Did Dr. Lecter shoot and kill Sgt. Pembry either before or after slicing his have face off? A gunshot is heard.",
      "answer": "Sgt. Pembry was one of the officers in charge of guarding Dr. Lecter while in custody in Memphis. He was killed by Lecter during his escape, after Lecter tricked him into opening his cell door and attacked him with a makeshift handcuff key. Lecter then sliced off Pembry's face and wore it as a disguise to fool the paramedics and escape in an ambulance. The gunshot that is heard is from Lecter shooting Officer Boyle, who was also guarding him, in the stomach. Lecter did not shoot Pembry, but he did break his neck and mutilate his face."

      "question": "Why does Clarice believe that \"Jack Gordon\" is actually Buffalo Bill?",
      "answer": "Her suspicions are aroused when \"Gordon\" asks if Frederika Bimmell was \"a great big fat person.\" Lecter pointed out that all of the victims were larger women, because the killer wants their skins to fit onto a man's body. That Gumb's first thought of a woman he didn't otherwise recognize was her size was enough to make Starling want to find out more. Once inside his house, Clarice recognizes the Death's Head (moth) in the living room. Gumb gives his name as \"Jack Gordon.\" Those initials, J.G., are consistent with \"Jame Gumb\" and \"John Grant,\" both aliases named by Crawford."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "From Lecter's advice-that Bill covets that which he sees every day-Clarice and Ardelia deduce that the first victim could have been someone who Bill knew personally. Clarice drives to Belvedere, Ohio to talk with the father of the first victim, Frederika Bimmel. In looking over Frederika's bedroom, Clarice finds a music box ballerina, in which she finds a false bottom that contains pictures obviously missed during previous investigations. On the pictures, Frederika is seen posing, wearing only underwear, suggesting that there was indeed an unknown man in her life who took the pictures, most likely her murderer. Clarice goes through a wardrobe and notices the triangular gussets on Frederika's dresses match the pieces of skin Bill cut from one of his victims. Clarice calls Jack Crawford () to inform him that Bill is making a \"woman suit\" of real skin. Crawford is already in route to Chicago, having identified Bill as Jame Gumb, but they find that the house where he's supposedly living has been abandoned. Clarice continues to poke around in Belvedere and interviews one of Frederika's friends, who points to the house of \"old Mrs Littman\" where she was often hanging around. Mrs Littman doesn't live there any more, but the current resident, who calls himself Jack Gordon, offers to give her Mrs Littman's son's business card and invites Clarice inside to wait. When she notices spools of thread and a Death's-Head moth, she realizes that Jack Gordon is really Jame \"Buffalo Bill\" Gumb. She pulls her gun on him, but Gumb leads her on a wild goose chase into the basement, where he has Catherine Martin imprisoned in a well. Gumb dons a night vision mask and turns out the lights, leaving Clarice to feel around in the dark. When he makes the mistake of cocking his gun, Clarice shoots him. Catherine is subsequently rescued. In the final scenes, Clarice is shown graduating from the Academy. At the party that follows, she receives a phone call from Lecter, calling from the airport on the island of Bimini in the Bahamas. He assures her that he's not about to come looking for her and requests that she extend him the same courtesy, which Clarice cannot do, of course. He then says that he must hang up because he's \"having an old friend for dinner\", as he watches Dr. Frederick Chilton deplane. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to Dr. Chilton?",
      "answer": "The closing, where Hannibal says: \"I'm having an old friend for dinner\" as he watches Dr. Chilton deplane, strongly suggests that Chilton ended up as one of Hannibal's meals. A small reference was made in the sequel novel Hannibal, where it was mentioned that Chilton disappeared seven years earlier while on vacation, strongly suggesting Hannibal had gotten his revenge (albeit in the novel, Chilton disappeared in Jamaica, not the Bahamas). However, this is never specifically stated in the sequel movie. The only reference to Dr. Chilton in Hannibal is made by Barney, when he says that Lecter, when possible, preferred to eat \"the rude,\" and Dr. Chilton \"was a bad man,\" which also strongly implies Chilton became Hannibal's victim."
