      "question": "Jordan says that Quaaludes were \"scheduled oned\" by the FDA. What does that mean?",
      "answer": "It means that they were put on a list of drugs that had a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use, and a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision. As such, Quaaludes could not be legally produced anymore, and given the trade secrecy surrounding the synthetic drug, one would be hard-pressed to produce them at all; hence Belfort saying there was a \"finite\" number of them left."

      "question": "Why does the movie end in Auckland, New Zealand?",
      "answer": "Three possibilities: (1) It is a subtle Scorsese-joke based on the New Yorker who thought he was going to Oakland, California, but got on the wrong plane, (2) It is an unsubtle Scorsese-joke coming from the fact that New Zealanders have elected a Prime Minister, a multi-millionaire former currency-dealer at Merrill-Lynch, and (3) The dull-witted pen sellers epitomize the pits to which Belford has descended."
