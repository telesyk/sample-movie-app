      "question": "Is this based on any real facts? Did any European person live with natives as one of them?",
      "answer": "Read \"Empire of the Summer Moon\". The John Wayne movie \"The Searchers\" probably used the story of Cynthia Ann Parker as source material. Quanta Parker, Cynthia's son, died in 1911, and was the 'last' chief of the Comanche people. What a story!"

      "question": "Is it true that around that time the Sioux tribe was finished? Are the buffalo extinct?",
      "answer": "While buffalo is used as a colloquialism for bison, they are not the same animal. They are both in the bovidae family, but not related.North American bison used to number in the tens of millions, and were hunted to near extinction with between only 800-1100 remaining in the wild. Today, wild bison are rare (numbering around 30,000); however, livestock ranchers maintain a population of approximately 400,000."

      "question": "Why did Major Fambrough act so strangely?",
      "answer": "Because he was seriously depressed, if not mentally ill.In those days, the less competent officers were assigned to frontier outposts. This was especially true at that time since the best officers would be needed in the East to fight in the war. The exile and resulting isolation caused many of them to become crazy. Typically, these officers would turn to consuming alcohol and fraternizing with illicit women to fill their time.The bottles of alcoholic drinks, strewn about Major Fambrough's office, suggest that he has become a heavy drinker--most likely an alcoholic. His quivering hands, while writing the note, suggests excessive alcohol consumption or possibly a sexually transmitted disease, like syphilis (both of which were fairly common in those days in frontier outposts). Either the alcohol consumption or sexually transmitted disease most likely caused brain damage and led to (or enhanced) his insanity.His insanity, in turn, motivated his strange behavior, such as addressing himself as \"king\" and those around him as \"knights\" and \"subjects\" and ultimately led him to commit suicide."

      "question": "When John Dunbar is sent to Fort Hays after his suicide attempt, his superior officer says to him, \"I have just pissed in my pants and nobody can do anything about it.\" What does he mean by that?",
      "answer": "Major Fambrough the senior officer, throughout the entire scene, demonstrates his lack of sanity. In the next scene just before he commits suicide, he again speaks with another officer as if he was one of his royal subjects. It's assumed that because he is the \"king\", nobody can stop him from doing what he wants. He is saying to Dunbar, I am totally in charge of you. I can even piss in my pants and you or nobody else can do anything about it. It shows the effect of having to live on the frontier, as it would generally have been the incompetent or the more lowly officers who would have been \"exiled\" to frontier posts rather than have them in a more active duty, and the loneliness and distance from what they would consider civilization eventually drove them mad. This is reinforced by the abandonment of Sedgwick by its previous occupants and their bizarre behaviour, the killing of the deer, using them to poison the pond, and the fact that they were living in caves rather than the fort itself, and also the questioning of Dunbar as to why he volunteered for the duty when he was a decorated Lieutenant."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why were the men living in the small caves instead of Fort Sedgwick?",
      "answer": "The men were in caves because he had provided no (or totally inadequate) leadership after having been abandoned/forgotten by the Army and because they no longer felt safe in the fort, fearing Indian attacks at any time."

    {
      "question": "What are the differences between the theatrical version and the Extended Version?",
      "answer": "All in all, the Extended Version offers changes at 64 points of the movie (compared to the theatrical version). The most common change is the insertion of new scenes or the extension of scenes that were already included in the theatrical version. However, there are also a lot of title cards and alterations regarding the arrangement of scenes. In total more than 50 minutes of new footage have been added."

      "question": "Why did Dunbar leave the Sioux tribe with his wife?",
      "answer": "The Sioux tribe was in danger because the US Cavalry discovered that Dunbar was a traitor and that he sided with the Sioux. Dunbar realized that he had become a fugitive and a deserter, thus he decided to leave them because as long as he stayed with them, he would continue to draw unwanted attention from the army and endanger the lives of the Sioux warriors and their wives and children. The Sioux reluctantly accepted Dunbar's decision. Stands with a Fist also decided to leave together with Dunbar."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did Lt. Dunbar and Stands with a Fist leave the tribe?",
      "answer": "The US army was in a \"soft war\" with the natives. They weren't sending many troops, because they were also on the called civil war, but they had these outposts to make their presence known. Also, as depicted in the movie, they used to send infrequent armies to fight the natives to retrieve stolen goods and hostages.When Lt. Dunbar leaves his post and joins the Sioux, he's seen as a traitor. His rescue and killing of all guards would obviously be seen as an unforgettable taunt and a real threat.Among this real reason to send an even bigger army to fight them, this would also be the opportunity needed for anybody wanting to actively fight the natives, or wanting to lead an army and increase in ranks.Knowing all that, Dunbar decided to leave the tribe, surrender, and use that to talk about a truce and how good people the natives are, to anybody that would listen to it. In this action, he both removes the motivation to raid them, and creates the chance to make European people learn about them.Stands with a Fist, as his wife, goes with him. It's not depicted if she had second thoughts but surely she wasn't forced to go."
