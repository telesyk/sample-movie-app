    {
      "question": "Is The Terminator a hero?",
      "answer": "Yes and no. The Terminator is, after all, simply following orders from a future John Connor. However, as the film progresses, it's clear that The Terminator has developed some form of affection for John, noted when Sarah indirectly refers to it as a father figure. The Terminator's feelings, a rare example of its free will, is on display when it tells John in the end that he \"know(s) now why (John cries)\". Thus, The Terminator can be seen not acting solely because of his mission, but in that he actually felt emotion and affection toward the Connors."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the T-1000 stick to the appearance of the first person that he killed throughout the whole movie? Any time he kills and takes the form of a person he always changes back to the first policeman he killed",
      "answer": "The T-1000's default appearance is that of Robert Patrick. The police officer he kills looked quite different from him. He simply takes the officer's uniform, gun and equipment. The T-1000 would keep this uniform as his default appearance because being disguised as a police officer offered him significant advantages in several scenarios: it could simply hide in plain sight. It also offered the opportunity to meet with John's foster parents and find out where he might have gone."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the hospital scene when Terminator and John rescue Sarah. The T-1000 goes through the bars and then the pistol gets caught in the bars what does that represent?",
      "answer": "He is made out of liquid metal, so he can just \"walk through\" the bars while feeding himself around them (by turning sections of him liquid), most likely to intimidate the people he's after. However, the gun is just a normal gun he'd picked up, and so at the angle he was holding it at, it couldn't get through the bars so it got stuck."
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the point of the piece of the T-1000 that stuck to the back of the security car?",
      "answer": "It was just to show that, being composed of a polymimetic alloy (liquid metal), all pieces could be recombined into the whole terminator.Also, in the book \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day: The Book Of The Film - An Illustrated Screenplay\" it's explained that this is the only time that John actually comes into physical contact with his enemy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do they keep wasting bullets and shotgun shells shooting the T-1000 over and over again?",
      "answer": "Shooting can slow down the T-1000 significantly, if it is targeted a certain way. In their first encounter, the T-800 shoots the T-1K several times, throwing it back. It needs a few moments to recover and reset itself to engage again. When the T-800 and John rescue Sarah from the hospital, you'll notice the T-800 shoots the T-1K in the hip, which staggers it a bit. However, the programming that controls the T-1K has probably learned how to recover more quickly because the shot hardly slows it down. However, when the T-800 blasts it at the elevator doors, it's enough of a blow to scramble the T-1K's programming a bit more.In the Terminators case, maybe lacking any specific method of killing a T-1000 he just defaults to \"shoot it until it dies\". In Sarah's case, maybe it's a just a compulsion to fight at all costs, no matter how futile. If you know your target can be damaged or slowed down, albeit not permanently or only on a hit to a vital point, it makes complete sense to keep pumping lead into it. Sure, odds are good you won't make a vital shot, but you'll still hopefully damage it."

      "question": "In the first movie Reese said that \"no one else comes through, it's just him and me\" and that the TDE (Time Displacement Equipment) was blown up after he went in. So how come two more travelers appear ten years later?",
      "answer": "\"Reese didn't know about the jeopardy that John Connor was to face at age 10, and neither did Sarah. So, that was the starting point\" - James Cameron (Starlog #171)Reese couldn't know what happened after he left his time, and also couldn't be told. When Reese disappeared, John Connor knew he had to send one more protector because he knew that another assassin was sent, and this time to 1995. He alone had this knowledge. The extended T2 script, novelization and T2: Nuclear Twilight #4 comic book all depicted the scene the same way. From the script, right after Reese disappears:FUENTES Sapper team. Set your charges. Let's blow this place back to Hell.Connor shakes his head no. Mustering his strength.CONNOR Not yet. There's one more thing we have to do.After the second protector is sent, then they destroy the TDEIt is not clear when exactly Skynet sent his two terminators. It was shortly before the war was over, but when exactly is not clear. The Resistance was able to sent their protectors only after Skynet was defeated and all machines stopped functioning, in July of 2029. It was then that they could enter Skynet's facilities, access abandoned TDE and do their part.Reese still suspected that Skynet might've sent more than one Terminator before getting destroyed. From the final shooting script of the first movie, the motel scene:SARAH He'll find us, won't he?REESE Probably. Sarah, if I get zeroed--SARAH Don't say that.REESE If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything. In case they send another one."

    {
      "question": "Is the opening scene a final battle?",
      "answer": "Yes. It was already made clear in the first movie that Skynet's fall is inevitable at that point and its last try was to try to erase Connor's existence. The war was won in 2029CONNOR (V.O.) Skynet, being almost infinitely smart, was also infinitely tricky. It knew it was losing, so it thought of a way to rig the game...Technicians have pulled up floor panels and tapped directly into cabling of the machine, using portable terminals that they have wheeled in. Many of the soldiers in this war against machines are technical specialists... you have to fight fire with fire.CONNOR (V.O.) And now, though we've won the war, there is still one battle left to fight. The most important one. It will be fought in the past, almost four decades ago... before all this began...The novelization, T2: Nuclear Twilight comic and extended script itself confirm the victory, which also allows Connor and his team to enter Skynet's facilitiesThe sudden silence takes the humans by surprise. They slowly emerge from their rat-warren emplacements and approach the frozen machines. We hear a voice speaking over a radio headset. It is filled with awed emotion.HEADSET VOICE (O.S.) ... The Colorado Division confirms that Skynet has been destroyed... The war is over... I repeat, Skynet has been destroyed.CAMERA TRACKS along the soldiers, bleeding, frostbitten, wrapped in rags... Valley Forge with better weapons. The wounded soldier in the ruins of the building cautiously approaches the chrome skeleton before him. He pushes against its chest with one finger. It topples with a crash and lies still. The soldier turns to his comrades with an idiot grin. Tears are streaming down his face. A mighty cheer goes up from the men and woman of the Last Army."

    {
      "question": "Why didnt the T-1000 bring any weapons with him?",
      "answer": "It turns out the T-1000 had been encased in a fleshy cocoon to be sent through the time machine. The plasma weapons known to be used by Terminators aren't tiny. It can't be fit within the confines of a human form that's curled into a low crouch. If the T-1000 didn't need a flesh cocoon, it could take any shape needed to accommodate a weapon, and in fact could have taken a whole Terminator with it! But with a flesh cocoon, a T-1000 couldn't realistically fit large, bulky items within itself without potentially compromising the integrity of the cocoon."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can the T-1000 see?",
      "answer": "The deleted scene of T-1000 searching John's room was specifically shot to show the audience that T-1000 doesn't see but that he senses, like an insect or Alien. He carefully touches and massages everything with the tips of his fingers. \"Touch\" is a key word here - it's the same way T-1000 samples objects.Novelization: \"(T-1000) took in the details of the neighborhood. It wasn't just his eyes he was seeing with. His entire body registered the environment in a dozen subtle ways\"\"It didn't need lights. It could sense the molecular structure of things by touch\"There's no distinction in T-1000's form - same drop or part can become a piece of leg, or an ear, nose or knee - doesn't matterNovelization: \"Sirens reached its auditory sensors, which could have been formed anywhere on its body (since every molecule had the genetic blueprints for all needed parts programmed into them), but were now in shape of human ears\""
    },
    {
      "question": "Why not T-900 ?",
      "answer": "It's likely there is a T-801 to T-999. They are simply never seen or mentioned. The T-1000 was simply a brand new, advanced prototype."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why didnt the T-800 kill anyone at the bar?",
      "answer": "The Terminator only uses deadly force when necessary. At this point, he was simply trying to obtain clothes and a vehicle and also had no weapons. It's also likely that the terminator deduced the bar was too public to go on a killing spree. Had he killed the bikers, any witnesses would go to the authorities and this would seriously hinder him at the start of his mission. However, if it just seemed like a brawl between bikers, it likely wouldn't be reported or at least dismissed as a simple fight. The Cigar Biker refused the terminator's demands and burned him with his cigar. This prompted the terminator to crush the biker's hand and throw him in to the kitchen. The next Biker hits the terminator in the back of the head with a pool cue. This would be little more than a pat on the back to the terminator. As the Terminator was still holding on to the Cigar biker at the time, he simply grabbed the Pool Cue Biker and threw him through the front window. Next the Biker with the knife stabs the terminator in the abdomen. The terminator quickly disarms him and stabs him in the shoulder, pinning him to the pool table. It's possible that the terminator did intend to kill him, and simply missed a lethal point. The terminator then goes to the kitchen to follow up with the Cigar Biker. The Biker was incapacitated and surrenders to the Terminator, so no need to kill him. Lastly was the Biker with the shotgun who tries to stop the terminator from taking the motorcycle. The Terminator likely scanned the Biker, based on pulse, temperature and pupil dilation that he wouldn't pull the trigger. (In Terminator 3, the new terminator, the T-850, makes the same sort of analysis of John Connor.)"

    {
      "question": "Why does it take so long for the terminators to arrive at John's house?",
      "answer": "Since most of the records were lost in the war, they didn't have knowledge of the pre-war Los Angeles. Both arrived in the middle of the night and there aren't many people at that time who can know and/or point the way and give directions to the specific address. Note that the T-1000 didn't know where the Reseda Mall is either and had to ask for directions. In the omitted scene, the girls are laughing at T-1000 for not knowing where such huge and well known mall is.It's possible, if John re-programmed the T-800 to protect him in the past, he simply told the terminator the address of his Foster home. Hence why the T-800 arrived well before the T-1000.The novelization also explains that time is of no importance for the T-1000. He is in no rush at all: The target's escape meant nothing to it. The delay could only be a measurement of time. Although terminators had internal chronometers, the T-1000 did not. It was part of Skynet's new design. Knowledge of time had its uses, but in most cases of pursuit, it was an unnecessary element.Time was only a temporary respite from inevitable."

    {
      "question": "Why was the first terminators arm so important?",
      "answer": "Because it's physical proof of advanced technology from the future."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was John spooked by T-800'S appearance?",
      "answer": "In the film, it can be assumed that John was just startled by a giant, leather-clad man, holding a box of roses, walking towards him while he was trying to flee from a cop. Once the terminator opened the box that revealed a shotgun, that would spook anyone.According to the novelization, John knew T-800's face from the newspaper clippings and knew it's probably the person responsible for the '84 police precinct massacre and the same person that his mother believed to be a Terminator.Novelization: In an instant, John recognized the face. He had seen it many times in the newspaper clippings his mother had shown him as he was growing up. It was that guy. The crazy dude who shot up that police station. The one his mother thought was a terminator."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who was the photographer at the galleria mall?",
      "answer": "This is actually the police officer 1-L-19, Nick Delaney, that got his head smashed against the car by T-800 in 1984. That is why he is so shocked when he sees him - he recognizes him and also knows that this person is a cop killer from '84.Later on in Pescadero the detectives show pictures of T-800 to Sarah. It's possible that those are the pictures provided to them by the above mentioned officer. Some say that it can't be so because the angles are different, but that's due to the fact that the pictures were taken a long time before the actual Mall scene was shot.The officer in both instances is played in cameo by William Wisher, who co-wrote the story and screenplay with James Cameron."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happened to Sarah's tapes for John?",
      "answer": "John left them in the house. When John was leaving his house that morning, he didn't know that he was never going to come back to it. While searching John's room, the T-1000 found the tapes from Sarah, along with all the letters, messages and pictures with her in John's room. This way he found Salceda's Ranch later on. A deleted scene seen only in the original script and storyboarded showed the T-1000 finding Salceda and torturing him for info about John, Sarah and the T-800. Since very shortly after the detectives seen in Pescadero already knew about John's foster parents being murdered, the tapes were most likely confiscated by the police."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the T-800 and T-1000 have detailed files on Dyson if the records were lost in the war?",
      "answer": "Dyson would be the first and most important person Skynet would want to know about. Same goes for his own history/development. How, who, when, where. And he had all the records about him - the address, everything. Who knows what else T-800 said to Sarah when she said that she wants to know everything. Dyson, unlike any other casual citizen, was a major figure in Cyberdyne. That's even underlined in T2 Extreme text commentary, saying that he was such a big shot there that they allowed him the unthinkable - to have a top secret model for CPU prototype at home on his desk. And again, he is the guy who'd done it all. Out of everyone around, Skynet would be the one to know all about Dyson. Out of all people, Dyson is the first choice. So even though there are no records available post Judgment Day, Skynet has all the data about his own history and creators since he 'lived' through it and it's a part of his memory/data bank.Novelization: Terminator searched his memory. There was a basic history of his time embedded in the circuits. Data useful as a basis for cross-reffing and scaling events in this time. Terminator gained access to it with prioritizing it as tactical information."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why don't the dogs bark at the T-800 at Salceda ranch?",
      "answer": "In the first scene shown there, as soon as Enrique and the rest come out of hiding, you can hear at least one dog barking continuously in the background. In most of the other scenes there in the desert, the T-800 is either out of sight (underground in the weapons bunker, underneath the truck), or the scenes take place after obviously quite some time has passed. By then the dogs have had time enough to get used to his presence. Also, Enrique could have trained the dogs to accept the terminator as a friend, IE, shaken hands with him, had the terminator feed them dog treats or food, spoken to the terminator in a friendly tone, any sort of friendly gesture that an owner shows to a stranger goes a long way to establish trust with a dog."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did the T-800 know that the T-1000 was piloting the helicopter?",
      "answer": "The blueprints for T-800 endoskull show something called \"Telepathic Communication Implant Cores\". This is most likely a device that allows terminators to communicate with each other and other futuristic Skynet machines. Since it's based on some kind of wireless signal, it's very possible that it allows terminators to sense each other's presence."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why doesnt the T-1000 call John himself?",
      "answer": "At that point, even thought he was doing his best, T-1000 failed to fool John while imitating Janelle. T2 Extreme text commentary explains that T-1000 couldn't calculate the individual behavior for human beings, and that's what the machines couldn't do and why they eventually lost the war. So before trying it again by himself, he tried to get Sarah to do it. Afterwards he does call John himself, and again he did not fool him. John suspected something immediately and stopped suddenly even before he saw real Sarah behind the fake or the boots imitating the grated floor. Another factor was that he was damaged and could not perfectly recreate with any given object anymoreVan Ling: One interesting flaw of the otherwise analytical T-1000 - it could not decipher the human behavior factor accurately enough to know how to correctly imitate. This is why AI has not been particularly successful in predicting and analyzing human behavior on individual level and why we can still beat the machines."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the T-1000 make a \"naughty\" finger gesture?",
      "answer": "Like mentioned before, T-1000 is it's own autonomous being. Frakes' novelization says that it learns, thinks and develops on it's own. By this point the T-1000 has developed an evil and nasty personality as explained by James Cameron:\"We saw the T-1000 as an advanced prototype, an experimental Terminator that could think and have a personality\""
    },
    {
      "question": "What changes were made to the timeline?",
      "answer": "One way or another, the future was altered by the events in T2. The novelization points out that it didn't happen the first time around, and instead, Sarah and John went into South America and waited until Judgment Day happened in 1997. Also, since Sarah and John went on record as terrorists who attacked Cyberdyne, such thing would surely be on records and Skynet would know about Cyberdyne attacks or Dyson's kidnapping by Connors. Yet, the T-1000 had no clue that they will head for Cyberdyne and only found out about it through the radio. If he'd knew it'll happen, he would wait for them there.The last deleted scene, the original ending, showed 2029 free of war, Sarah being a grandmother and happy that her son has become a father himself and is a US senator.The scene was cut for several reasons: the scene was too much of a contrast to the rest of the movie visually and narratively. The aged makeup on Linda Hamilton wasn't satisfactory for James Cameron either.Yet another reason is given in T2 Extreme DVD commentary. James Cameron states that he didn't want to be so blatantly obvious in showing that it all ended well. He said the audience 'got it' without seeing the scene. That would point out that the happy ending actually did take place in the intended Cameron's story, and its also included in the novelization.James Cameron furthermore explains:Basically, what I wanted to say in Terminator 2 was that everything is meant to be a certain way, everything has already been written. You can call it karma or destiny, whatever. So I asked myself a hypothetical question: what if you could you grab a line of history like it's a rope stretched between two points, and just pull it out of the way? If you can pull it just a little bit out of the way then cut it at that moment, maybe you could change it and history could go in a slightly different direction. Like the catastrophe theory. If you could actually do that you would get a future that no longer exists except in the memories of the people who are here now. They have a memory of a future that will never happen, which is curious, because it defies our Newtonian view of the world. But couldn't it be possible? That became my point of departure. It's like the Terminator is an anomaly of our time because he's the only one who has memories of a time that will never exist. His particular future does not exist anymore.Another thing worth mentioning is the fact that Sarah hired a private detective to find Kyle Reese in this altered, war-free future but he couldn't find him and Sarah eventually called off the search. It's very likely that the chain of events that led to Kyle's birth in the original future didn't happen this time around. Remember that Kyle said that he grew up after the war in the ruins. With no war it's possible that his parents haven't even met."

      "question": "Why is the T-800'S hair different?",
      "answer": "The conceptual artwork showed the remaining 9 inactive 101 models with the longer hair, as seen in the first movie, so it's clear that the issue of hair style change was supposed to be addressed.There's a theory that the resistance cut his hair short to have a better access to CPU. If they cut one spot to open the port cover, naturally they had to trim the whole thing now.Another theory that comes from T2 books is that there are variants within variants - same model may have different types of hair etc, which is unlikely since there are only 10 same looking modelsVan Ling gave two explanations: 1) Skynet may put different random haircuts on infiltrators to decrease the chance of zeroing them at a glance; 2) John Connor in the future may have had the T-800 prepped to look like the one he remembered from his childhood, because that's what was supposed to happen."

      "question": "Why send only one at a time?",
      "answer": "The activation of the TDE , which was a gargantuan machine going down deep into the bowels of the earth, required so much energy that it caused all of Skynet's machine temporary deactivation after each power up - it required massive amount of energy to send one object."

    {
      "question": "How is the flesh placed on a T-800 ?",
      "answer": "The teaser trailer for T2, directed by Stan Winston for $150,000 shows at least part of the procedure of how a T-800 comes off an assembly line and gets his flesh grown around the endoskeleton. A T-800 endoskeleton enters a living-tissue-casting machine and the flesh of the 101 model is molded onto the steel skeleton of the terminator."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the T-1000's model and data?",
      "answer": "T-800 clearly states that the enemy this time is:*T-1000 Advanced Prototype\"It's formed from a different, even more advanced metal - pollyalloy. Mimetic pollyalloy to be exact, which can be in both liquid and solid form. It's also referred to as 'liquid metal'There is only a series number and no model designation because it doesn't have any designated appearance. As mentioned in the movie, T-1000 is a one of a kind prototype. T-1000 is so powerful that even Skynet itself feared it, and would never use it of not the circumstances.it was fully autonomous, and barely under the allegiance of its creator, SKYNET. SKYNET had hesitated before creating this latest weapon system. There were unpredictability factors related to the liquid poly-mimetic alloy's longevity and the ability to process commands without interpolating its own priorities over those of its creator. it was so volatile a construct that only in the last throes of defeat, only when it appeared that the Resistance would finally be able to mount an offensive against the inner command components of SKYNET, even threatening the Cheyenne Mountain complex itself, did SKYNET go ahead and create the T1000. Einstein once said that God didn't play dice with the universe. SKYNET had no choice...\"The passage above also points out that T-1000 is autonomous, meaning it isn't controlled or dependent on Skynet. The reason is that it doesn't have CPU and is a brand new, completely different technology. It's almost like an artificial creature of sort, developing on it's own. It's never fully explained how T-1000 works, although it's confirmed that its built of thousands of tiny nano-bots that work together by both the novelization and James Cameron on T2 Extreme DVD commentary.T2 Novelization:\"Sirens reached its auditory sensors, which could have been formed anywhere on its body (since every molecule had the genetic blueprints for all needed parts programmed into them), but were now in shape of human ears\""

      "answer": "There are a few possible explanations. 1) Skynet possesses a vast amount of records from before Judgment Day. It could have computer records from veterinary clinics and Wolfie could be the name of a dog that was registered as vaccinated or admitted for treatment. The T-800's readout may have listed Sparky or Boomer as other possible names to use. 2) Skynet could have records from police departments. Wolfie may have been the name of a trained dog in a K-9 unit. 3) Wolfie could be the name of a dog used by the future resistance to sniff out terminators. Skynet may have heard the name while listening to radio dispatches. It could have also been overheard by an active terminator infiltration unit. Or it could simply be an improvisation on the terminator's part. The logic being \"Dogs go woof. Name the dog woofie\""

      "question": "Why does the T-1000 mimic the helmet and sunglasses of the motorcycle officer when it doesn't need them?",
      "answer": "The T-1000 could have considered the additional disguise to be advantageous in acquiring John Conner, who would easily recognize him without the helmet and glasses. By the time the T-1000 reforms in the steel mill, it no longer has these features, likely having recognized that they were pointless. The accessories also avoid any attention or scrutiny from other police who may have zeroed in on a cop riding a motorcycle with no helmet. The production explanation for this choice is that the stunt double would have needed to wear a helmet for the scene when the T-1000 hits the helicopter."

      "question": "If you touch a T-1000, would you feel skin?",
      "answer": "While the T-1000 is not covered in human tissue like the T-800, it is able to mimic hair and other fine details. To mimic the texture of skin, its nano-technology would have to imitate skin cells at a microscopic level as well as the composition of those cells. If the T-1000 was intended to replace the T-800 infiltration units, it is likely that Skynet sought to design it with this level of detail. However, given that the T-1000 has superior weapon capabilities and other sophisticated features, realistic skin texture was probably not prioritized when it was created."

      "question": "Why did the resistance send the same model Terminator Skynet used in 1984 back in time when that same model failed in 1984?",
      "answer": "The out-of-universe answer IS to bring back Arnold Schwarzenegger to reprise his role as the Terminator.As for the in-universe answer, fans can only theorize:1. Probably the T-800 was the most updated model the resistance could reprogram and send back -- there were no other options available to them. They sent the T-800 back and hoped for the best.2. Other fans claim that T-800 was a model Sara was familiar with, for better or for worse.3. A deeper theory says adult John Connor from 2029 sends this model on purpose, because he remembered it from his childhood (read about ontological paradox for a better understanding). This theory may have support in the novelization on the movie.This question is tricky. The fact the same model failed in 1984 had nothing with the resistance's choice. The resistance took other factors in consideration."

So even if Dyson created a virus (assuming he even had the skills to do so), he'd likely have to go to the lab in person to upload it to multiple terminals. Not to mention there would have been mountains of physical data.

      "question": "In what year does the film take place? There seem to be some continuity problems...",
      "answer": "The first Terminator film takes place in May 1984. According to information provided at the beginning of the movie, it is now 1994, but John was born on 28 February 1985 and is currently 10 years old. If the latter is the case, it contradicts the T-800's claim that it was sent back 35 years in time (from 2029), which would place the events of the film in 1994. Another piece of information that adds to the contradiction is provided when the T-800 states, \"in three years Cyberdyne will...\", which indicates the film takes place three years before Judgement Day (which occurs on 29 August 1997), again implying 1994.So, there are three explanations: (1) the logical (i.e. computationally-sound) and precise T-800 has an inaccurate awareness of the date to which it has time-traveled by citing by implication a present date figure that falls at least year short of what is accurate, (2) John is inaccurate about his own age by citing it at most a year higher (implying that he is 9 years old), or (3) the T-800 expresses positive numbers rounded to the nearest integer (meaning that a number as low as 2½ would be rendered as a \"three\"). Any combination of the of the aforementioned possibilities could also be a possibility. The third case implies that the film is set within days of John's tenth birthday, such that Judgement Day occurs less than 2½ years (or 30 months) afterward, but more important than Judgment Day, in this question, is Skynet's birthday (4 August 1997, its \"online\" date), leaving us to conclude that most likely John exaggerated his age by a few weeks. The problem with the implications of the third explanation of course is the non-cold winter weather even for the southern Californian climate. John having characteristics of a child older than nine years old is related to this question yet a whole other can of worms."

      "answer": "He's not the same Terminator and thus not the same character. Terminators are manufactured on an assembly line with many different models being produced -- which is used as a joke in a scene from Terminator 3. Many of these models have the same exterior appearance. The T-800 in T2 is the same model as the one from T1, but is not the same character. They just happen to have the same (or similar given Arnold's aging from 1984 to 1991) flesh and skin coating."

    {
      "question": "How can the T-1000 go through the time machine? It has no living tissue!",
      "answer": "The T-1000 is liquid metal, and only living human tissue will go through the time machine. The T-800 can go through because the metal endoskeleton is surrounded by human tissue. But the movie leaves some mystery as to what the machine actually is. When in its human form, the T-1000 might actually mimic human flesh. However, since the film really never specifically expands on the situation, it's considered a plot hole. Reese states in the original film that it has something to do with the field generated by a living organism, which is probably bioelectromagnetism, but doesn't elaborate further. That doesn't necessarily mean that only human or animal tissue can travel through time intact. It may mean that anything (machines included) that generates the proper kind of field can time travel. Since the T-1000 is so far advanced, it may generate the right type of field (that Reese was talking about) that earlier models could not without human flesh. Another possibility is that the T-1000 was outfitted with a simple layer of epidermis just before it was sent back through time. T-800s have a complete, fully functional skin with blood supply to keep the epidermis in shape and to ensure that wounds will heal, in order to keep the Terminator passable as a human. However, all the T-1000 may need is a simple layer of skin without blood vessels or other components of human flesh to get him across time, which he can dispose of after time-travel. Technically, we never really see in what state he arrived, and there was some time, maybe up to half a minute or so, between the electrical disturbances from the time-travel and T-1000's first on-screen appearance, where he kills the police officer. Perhaps he shed the skin in that short time. It's also possible that over time, Skynet was able to advance the technology of the time machine allowing it to send anything through, whether it has living tissue or not."

      "question": "Why didn't Reese warn Sarah about more-advanced Terminators travelling through time to kill her?",
      "answer": "Reese believed that once the Resistance had used the Time Displacement Field to send him back to 1984, it had been destroyed by his fellow soldiers. This information is described in the prologue of the official Terminator 2 novel where the original script can be read. However, after Reese was sent back in time, his unit (including an older John Connor) found liquid metal residue in Skynet's factories. It is implied that the T-1000 is an experimental unit at this point and that even Skynet is not fully sure of whether or not it can be controlled (due to how advanced it is, it may actually be more intelligent than Skynet, and has the potential to turn on its master). It is only to be activated as an act of desperation or a last resort should the humans actually destroy Skynet. John then decides to send a reprogrammed T-800 back to wherever the liquid metal creation was sent before destroying the Time Displacement equipment. One must also keep in mind that during the events of the first Terminator film, Reese and Sarah are only together for around 48 hours. Reese does not have a great deal of time to give a full description of future events and the full extent of the enemy's arsenal, and he is not even aware of the T-1000's existence (as it is a secret weapon). John Connor is the only one that is aware of it, and only because it was sent back in time to kill him. Why he could not himself have given this knowledge to Reese before the time journey depends upon the (as yet unproven) way in which time travel to the past would work, i.e. if there would be multiple, revised iterations of events, or if all events would piece together into a single continuity. An early T2 script (which can be read in Terminator 2: Judgment Day: The Book of the Film - An Illustrated Screenplay) also contained a comparable opening scene in the future, where the human resistance defeats the machines, enters the Skynet building, and sends Reese to the past. After he is gone, the men want to blow up the Time Displacement equipment, but John Connor tells them there is still one more thing to do. He goes into a cold storage room where several inactive T-800 Terminators are stored; one is already missing (an Arnold model). John looks at another, knowing he still needs to send this one to protect himself in the past. This scene was never shot for budgetary and other reasons."

    {
      "question": "If the Terminator, model 101, is a known multiple murderer from the first movie, why would the human resistence send back an identical model?",
      "answer": "According to the Cameron-Wisher original script draft and the official novelization by Randall Frakes, as well as creative consultant Van Ling, there were hundreds of different-looking T-800 terminators in Skynet's Terminator storage facility. However, the adult Connor went looking specifically for the model of Terminators that he remembered protecting him when he was ten years old. By sending back his father Kyle Reese and the protector Terminator, John was fulfilling his role in the predestination paradox (causal loop). When John entered the Terminator Cold Storage Facility to locate the deactivated \"Arnold\" model, Frakes writes: John panned his light around. There were hundreds of men and women, in rows of ten. Within each row, the bodies were absolutely identical. John quickly walked along the synthetic bodies to the end of a row and hesitated. He scanned the faces. No, not there. Then he gazed down the other row. All the same. Strange to him. Then...he turned to another row and stopped. It was filled with identical, familiar faces. The broad, brutally handsome features sent a shock of recognition through John. It was him. Both from the official Terminator 2 companion book and on the special edition T2 DVD, James Cameron and Stan Winston state that an unfilmed part of the script involved the rebels in 2029 destroying Skynet but finding a chamber where the T-800 Model 101 terminators were built. This chamber housed a sophisticated assembly line where the terminator parts were transported to a central point. Here they were welded together, programmed and placed inside a press that coated the outside of the endoskeleton with a organic tissue. The point of this sequence was to show how the rebels managed to not only find the Terminators but also the time displacement equipment that they could use to send back the reprogrammed cyborg. This sequence was ultimately excised from the movie due to financial constraints, but Stan Winston liked it so much that he recreated it for the first teaser trailer for T2, released one year before T2's July 1991 release."

      "question": "Where exactly is the T-1000's CPU located?",
      "answer": "Here are some clues from the official novel as to the nature of its design: (1) \"It didn't have a wafer-circuit brain to think with. It was something on a completely new level of artificial intelligence. The molecular brain acts like the rest of the thing, a liquid. And now it bubbled with possibilities. All of them lethal.\" [page 101], (2) \"The concept of pain had never factored into the sensory sphere of the liquid machine. Pain was an indicator of damage to a part of the organism. But this 'organism' didn't have parts, except on the molecular level. And its molecules were each primitive, miniaturized versions of the total machine. If any section parted, the separated halves would revert to metal poly-alloy. The only default command it had in molecular memory was to find the main mass again and rejoin it. Each molecule had a range of fourteen kilometres.\" [page 132], and (3) \"Skynet itself had hesitated before making this latest weapon. There were unpredictability factors related to the thing's longevity and ability to process commands without interpolating its own priorities. It was so volatile a construct, that only in the last throes of utter defeat, when the plug was about to be pulled, had Skynet sent the terminators through time to change the outcome of the war. And only in the very last micro-second before shutdown, had the hypercomputer sent the T-1000... Skynet had no choice.\" [page 178] In short, the T-1000 has microscopic feedback control centers in every part of its mass, and they work together roughly like a wireless cluster computing network."

    {
      "question": "Why didn't the T-1000 know how to quickly kill the T-800, an inferior model?",
      "answer": "The T-1000 has at least three hand-to-hand encounters with the T-800. At no point does it seem to have a direct understanding of how to efficiently disable it. The reasons behind this are not known, but there are several common suggestions:1. The T-1000 is a prototype and has incomplete programming about T-800 design/anatomy.2. The T-1000 simply wasn't designed or programmed to fight other terminators.3. T-800s in general are not easy to kill and as such, there may very well not be a simple, quick, \"efficient,\" way to simply destroy one. Their fuel cells are located in their abdominal area, but this location is heavily protected with thick armor. The same has to be true for their chip in their cranium. If bullets from most high powered rifles and handguns are unable to penetrate these areas, its unlikely a T-1000 would be able to stab through the armor either. Conflictingly a knife can penetrate armour designed to minimise bullet damage such as a bullet proof vest. A T-800 will have full military grade armour but this was pierced because the stabbing weapon had behind it the immense force generated by the T-1000 when it targeted the fuel cells. A human would unlikely manage to do the same although a purpose built bolt for a high power crossbow is feasible. It's assumed the T-1000 was unaware the T-800 had an alternative power supply.4. The T-1000's primary objective is to kill John Connor, not eliminate every threat that may interfere with this mission. Getting away, or delaying your enemy's advance, can be just as effective. Also, every moment spent fighting the T-800 gives John more time to escape. Losing track of him hinders its mission considerably. However, it is noteworthy that in the final hand-to-hand battle in the steel mill, the T-1000 did engage in a lengthy fight with the T-800. It may have allowed some time to do this thinking that it is unlikely that John would be able to get away under the current setting.5. The T-800 may be considered an \"inferior model\" but it clearly has considerable strength and abilities. The superiority spoken of may refer to total life span, the ability to change its form, less physical damage from bullet impacts, etc. Consider a knife vs. a gun. A gun may be superior, but a knife can still do a great deal of damage, even penetrating material which bullets can not."

    {
      "question": "Is the timeline altered when Cyberdyne is destroyed?",
      "answer": "Yes; according to James Cameron; Judgment Day, the nuclear war and Skynet are completely eradicated from all future timelines by the end of this movie: Basically, what I wanted to say in Terminator 2 was that everything is meant to be a certain way, everything has already been written. You can call it karma or destiny, whatever. So I asked myself a hypothetical question: what if you could you grab a line of history like it's a rope stretched between two points, and just pull it out of the way? If you can pull it just a little bit out of the way then cut it at that moment, maybe you could change it and history could go in a slightly different direction. Like the catastrophe theory. If you could actually do that you would get a future that no longer exists except in the memories of the people who are here now. They have a memory of a future that will never happen, which is curious, because it defies our Newtonian view of the world. But couldn't it be possible? That became my point of departure. It's like the Terminator is an anomaly of our time because he's the only one who has memories of a time that will never exist. His particular future does not exist anymore. However, this was changed in Terminator 3, and in the accompanying television series, neither of which were made with any input from the writers of the first 2 films. T3 introduced the idea that Judgment Day is inevitable; it was merely postponed when Cyberdyne was destroyed. Humanity will eventually seal its fate by continuing to develop artificial intelligence, which one day will overthrow mankind. Cameron did shoot an alternative ending almost 40 years in the future, where Judgment Day did not happen and the Earth was safe, but he deleted it because it was too cheerful compared to the rest of the movie, and not in line with the powerful message of the movie: that the future is not set. He chose a more ambiguous ending instead. However, we must also note that due to the films after T2, we must look to the predestination paradox to explain this answer. The predestination paradox explains that whatever has happened was meant to happen. A time-traveller attempting to alter the past in this model, intentionally or not, would only be fulfilling his role in creating history as we know it, not changing it, or that the time-traveller's personal knowledge of history already includes his future travels to his own experience of the past. Effectively, it means this: the time-traveller is in the past, which means he was in the past before. Therefore, his presence is vital to the future, and he does something that causes the future to occur the same way his knowledge of the future knows has already happened. What this means is that Judgement Day never really happened in 1997. Sarah Connor said that it would be in 1997 because she did not know what would happen in the events of T2. So, conclusively, if we look at the Terminator saga as a whole, the answer to this question is no. When time-travelling happens in the Terminator saga, nothing really changes, because what is done in the past has already affected the future in which the time-travellers came from."

      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "After freeing its arm from the cogwheel, the T-800 continues to pursue the T-1000 who has Sarah pinned by his left finger blade through her shoulder. The T-800 sneaks up behind and rams the T-1000 with a steel bar, but the T-1000 easily pulls it out and turns it on the T-800 then pounds him with a heavy metal beam, mashing his head and exposing his robotic eye. When the T-800 tries to get to his grenade launcher, the T-1000 impales him with the metal bar through his abdomen, pining him to the grated floor. The T-800 is zapped by electricity and goes limp. The T-1000 continues to go after John, mimicking Sarah's voice to lure him closer. Meanwhile, the T-800 boots back up using an alternate power route. He pulls out the iron bar, grabs the grenade launcher, and crawls up to the platform where the T-1000 has taken Sarah's form. Suddenly, the real Sarah appears behind the T-1000-Sarah and blasts it with several rounds from her shotgun until she runs out of ammo. The T-800 finishes with his grenade launcher, sending the T-1000 plummeting into a vat of metal.and is dissolved. John tosses in the remaining robotic arm and the microchip, and they rejoice that it's over. However, the T-800 reminds them that there is one more microchip—the one in his head—and that they must destroy him, too. John pleads with him to stay with them, but the Terminator won't take no for an answer. He can't terminate himself, so he hands Sarah the remote control and steps onto the pulley. Slowly, she lowers him into the vat of molten metal where he is consumed. In the final scene, Sarah and John drive down the highway, and Sarah says in an voiceover: The unknown future rolls towards us. I face it for the first time with a sense of hope. Because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too."

      "answer": "The movie and the novel are in conflict concerning this question. In the novel, the T-800 immediately commits suicide by stepping into the molten steel once the T-1000 has died. In the movie, this moment is drawn out to generate emotional issues about the T-800's mortality. However, as a soldier doing a duty, the T-800 probably would not have required others to end his life when the future was at stake. The T-800's death sequence from the official novel: Terminator put his hand on John's shoulder. \"I must complete my mission.\" And as he said that, the human side of his face came back into the light. He reached toward John and his metal finger touched the tear trickling down his cheek. It was the revelation. \"I know now why you cry, although it is something I can never do.\" He turned to Sarah and said, \"Goodbye.\" \"Are you afraid?\" There was the briefest instant before he responded. \"Yes,\" he said. Not because he was going to cease functioning as a terminator, but because he had sensed a vision beyond his programming of a cosmic order vast beyond Skynet's comprehension. And it gave him a sense of his first feeling. Fear. Of where he was going next, if anywhere. Of course, he hadn't been asked for further details on his answer, so he didn't say any of this. He simply turned and stepped off the edge. [page 235] During the scene when collecting weapons from the hidden cache at the compound of Enrique, John Connor asks the T-800 if it felt fear. To this the T-800 simply replies, \"No.\" John then asks, \"Not even of dying?\" The T-800 again replies, \"No.\" John Connor presses further, \"You don't feel any emotion about it one way or another?\" This is when the T-800 says conflictingly, \"No, I have to stay functional until my mission is complete.

At the last second it formed into a fist with the thumb extended, a final thumbs-up. Then it was really gone. Mother and son watched the molten metal for a while. Then John remembered the Terminator's other arm back down the row of smelters, and ran to get it. It was a pile of useless, twisted metal, but the metal was from the future and this time they weren't leaving anything to chance. When John tossed the pieces in, one by one, he and Sarah felt a shudder deep within the bowels of the earth. As if a massive pivot was turning.

      "question": "If the creation of Skynet was inspired by its own technology, how can any of this be possible?",
      "answer": "This is called an ontological paradox. It's not clear how these would resolve in reality. While it may be logically confusing to track exactly where and how Skynet originated, understanding of time and space in the future may have advanced enough to accept that Skynet needed to send terminators back through time, not to ensure its seeds were planted, but to protect its inevitable creation from its enemies like John Connor. This reasoning, however, goes deeper than what the movie describes about Skynet's ambitions. Assuming that mankind will one day, be it in the near or distant future, invent microchips and machines smart enough to take over control, Judgment Day will also happen sooner or later. As a result of the human resistance, Skynet sends Terminators to the past to kill their leader and protect its own existence. However, they leave traces of their technology behind in the past, causing the creation of Skynet to occur earlier and the date of Judgment Day to be pushed backwards in the timeline. So Skynet's technology does not directly influence its own creation per se, but merely the time of its creation. Basically, despite the message of the film being that there is no fate, some things are inevitable, and even if the events of The Terminator (1984) hadn't taken place, Skynet would eventually have been built somehow. The placing of the original arm only built the foundations quicker."

      "question": "If Skynet believes it can alter the future, why is the T-800 hesitant about doing the same?",
      "answer": "The T-800's mission is to ensure the survival of John Connor. The fact that the future John Connor didn't reprogram the T-800 to consider such a side mission derives from an obvious inability to predict what Skynet might already have planned. It was better to simply escort the young John Connor into indefinite seclusion. Another possibility is that the future John had simply accepted the fact that, despite what he made Kyle memorise on the subject, while the future can be altered, the big picture remains pretty much the same. Also, if the Terminator did somehow purge Skynet's existence, John never would have been born."

    {
      "question": "How can there be sequels, \"Rise of the Machines\", \"Salvation\" and \"Genisys\", if all the technology concerning Skynet was destroyed?",
      "answer": "The 3rd, 4th and 5th films, along with the television series, can be alternative interpretations/spinoffs, as James Cameron considered the story closed, with his own original ending featuring an elderly Sarah surrounded by grandchildren and John becoming a Senator in what appears to be a peaceful future time. According to the writers of the new films, while Skynet was physically destroyed, the idea of Skynet (i.e. A.I.) is irreversible and therefore the creation of Skynet was merely postponed. This is explained more clearly in a deleted scene from T3, which can be found on the DVD. Also, when the T-800 loses its arm in the gears during the fight at the steel mill, it is still there at the end of the movie; it wasn't destroyed in the molten steel like the rest. Another possibility is that Dyson wasn't the only one who brought work home, and other Cyberdyne workers could have the data for the chip on their home computers. There could also have been an offsite server that kept the files saved, so if the building was lost the files wouldn't be lost as well. If the future war never happens, then the Terminator never came back for the first movie, and neither did Kyle Reese. If Reese never came back, then there is no John Connor. If someone from the future changes the past and changing the present to one in which that future never happened, then theoretically you unmake the past, as well. This is all according to the Eternalism theory of time. The \"Growing Block\" theory of time allows the events of this movie to take place (i.e., for there to never be a war, but the Terminators/Reese still travel back; likely what Cameron intended). If one takes the novelization of T3, all of the patents and research were backed-up off-site. After the company headquarters was lost; the Defense Department obtained the patents and contracted with the Air Force and Cyber Research Systems to continue Cyberdyne's artificial intelligence projects. Skynet's completion and Judgment Day was merely postponed 7 years. One could also consider an original timeline where Skynet was still developed by Cyberdyne even without the arm and the microchip.(and cus terminator is a proffitable franchise)"

    {
      "question": "John demonstrates a knowledge for computer hacking. Is this Skynet's main concern?",
      "answer": "John shows an interest for hacking ATMs and manages to bypass the security systems at Cyberdyne. This could be why he is a threat to Skynet. Unfortunately, this character trait wasn't elaborated on in Terminator 3. This may indicate that the time-line has been altered with the destruction of Cyberdyne. However, it was Reese who said in The Terminator that it was John who taught the human resistance to fight and physically destroy the machines. The opening scene of T2 shows adult John coordinating the battle against the machines, and according to young John, he was instructed in all kinds of weapons in order to become a great military leader. This would suggest that tactical skills are still John's major talents. Additionally, in T3, John says, in his opening narration, that he chose to \"live off the grid\" meaning that he didn't want to have any sort of public identity, especially not one online, so that he wouldn't be found. His motivation for doing so is not entirely clear but we can probably assume it's because he didn't fully believe that Judgement Day had been prevented and that Skynet's existence had not entirely been wiped out. As it turns out, he was right. And his strategy works: the T-850 that's sent to protect him specifically says, \"You could not be located, so Skynet sent another terminator to kill your lieutenants.\" That the T-X terminator found John was blind luck."

    {
      "question": "What methods are there for killing a Terminator?",
      "answer": "A T-800 is composed of solid armor, so it is resistant to small arms fire. It may be possible to damage or even destroy a T-800 with armor piercing bullets, but the movies never address this. Unlike the T-1000, the T-800 is unable to reform its chassis if it is damaged. Because of this, a T-800 can be destroyed with any type of explosive weapon, such as a grenade, a grenade launcher, a pipe bomb, a rocket launcher, etc. A directed energy weapon like a plasma rifle is probably the most common way to kill a T-800 in 2029. The characters in the movies did not have access to weapons like these for obvious reasons. Any significant damage to the structural integrity of the chassis will either disable or destroy the T-800, as is shown in the first movie with the hydraulic press. The answer for the T-1000 is more unclear. The second movie gives us a few hints. No type of firearm will permanently damage the T-1000, although being shot multiple times seem to slow it down for a few seconds, while it regains shape. When Arnold shoots the T-1000 with the grenade launcher, it seems to damage the T-1000 so significantly that it cannot immediately reform its original shape and even loses orientation. This may be because of the damage to the T-1000 caused by being frozen by liquid nitrogen. We saw that the T-1000 was malfunctioning after this from the way it involuntarily changed to its surroundings, once sticking to the railing and again when its feet exposed the ruse of pretending to be Sarah Connor. Apparently, shapeshifting takes time, as is also seen in the scene where it has spread out on the floor and then slowly forms into the shape of a man. Conclusively, explosive weapons are a vague possibility. The T-1000 is sensitive to extreme heat, therefore a plasma rifle or any other type of energy based weapon could either damage or destroy it. Exposing it to extreme heat, as is shown in Terminator 2, will kill it. Exposing it to extreme cold incapacitates the T-1000s and has been shown to damage them also. This theoretically suggests the shattered pieces of frozen T-1000 could have been collected up and kept in a frozen state, or perhaps dropped from air over a vast area of an ocean. The low temperature and the pressure on the ocean bed and the vast distances involved would make it improbable for the pieces to relocate each other."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are there other ways besides extreme heat to deactivate the T-1000?",
      "answer": "Probably. This is suggested by a few shots that were cut from the theatrical version, and were restored in the Special Edition. After the T-1000 is frozen and thaws up again in the steel mill, he follows John, Sarah and Terminator. As he walks he grabs onto a steel yellow/black striped bar, and something strange happens: his hand automatically \"fuses\" with the bar, mimicking the striped color pattern. He pulls himself loose, looks somewhat confused, and changes his hand back with a fast flick. He then enters an area with a metal profile floor, and his feet uncontrollably take over the color and texture of that floor. The last shot shows John with the two Sarahs, noticing that the feet of the first Sarah seem to be fused to the grated floor. These scenes show that the T-1000 has indeed been damaged by the nitrogen freezing, as he has difficulties maintaining his current shape; his shapeshifting abilities seem partly out of his control. This indicates that the T-1000, although extremely resilient, still consists of fragile microtechnology that can be damaged. Being metal, he could be vulnerable to certain acids as well (as carried out in Genisys). Also, because of the heat from the steel mill, it is possible that the extreme heat was assisting in the adhering to the metal railing and grated floor. A EMP (electromagnetic Pulse) could be generated which would shut down maybe even damage electronics in general. Ironically, the most abundant source for EMP is a nuclear explosion."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do the T-1000's clothes remain intact despite the damage done to the terminator during the various battles?",
      "answer": "As shown on the movie, when the T-1000 shifts into new shape it is fully clothed. This would lead to the conclusion that any clothing it might appear to be wearing is also being imitated by its poly-alloy material, thus making it unnecessary for it to acquire any new clothing after being damaged. This does not apply for the T-800 model. As seen in the the first three films in the franchise, the T-800 must find a person who matches his body type and take their clothes (usually by force) and put them on himself. You can spot several bullet holes in the T-800's clothing in the end part of the movie. In T2, when the T-1000 kills the police officer at the beginning, he does not take off the officer's uniform and put it on himself, he simply mimics the image of the uniform with his built in poly-alloy, making the uniform itself nothing more than a part of his body which will heal rapidly. The only thing he takes off the officer is his standard issue Beretta 92FS and the extra ammo from his belt."

    {
      "question": "How were the Terminators after \"T1\" sent back in time if the humans won the war?",
      "answer": "In The Terminator, Dr. Silberman asked, \"Why didn't this computer just kill Connor then? Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator?\", and Kyle replied, \"It had no choice. Their defense grid was smashed, we'd won, taking out Connor then would make no difference. Skynet would have to wipe out his entire existence.\" Dr. Silberman asked, \"Is that where you captured the lab complex and found the, what is it called, the, time displacement equipment?\", and Kyle said, \"That's right. The Terminator had already gone through, Connor sent me back to intercept and they blew the whole place.\" The humans had not yet won the war in the future when the Terminators were sent back. They had Skynet \"on the brink,\" but hadn't yet finished it off. One can presume that all of the Terminators were sent back at the same time, each targeted at a specific point in the past. Why Reese only appears to know of the one sent to 1984 is another matter. According to the original draft of the Terminator 2 script, after Connor sent back Kyle, he went to a cold storage facility where he finds a whole row of 800-series model 101 Terminators with one missing (the first Terminator), and picks one off the line. This is probably why Kyle didn't know about second Terminator. According to The Future War, the final novel in the trilogy based on T2; Skynet sent back the original Terminator, and the T-100 and a female (only important to the book, not the T-X). Kyle Reese volunteers on the spot to go back, and then a reprogrammed Terminator (T-800 from T2) is sent back next. So it may be that Reese is aware and knows Sarah still is skeptical, so he only mentions the current Terminator due to him being the primary danger to the world."

    {
      "question": "If the Terminator is an infiltration unit who can mimic voices, why does it speak with a thick Austrian accent while in America?",
      "answer": "The real-life answer is because that is how the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger talks. The Terminator universe answer is that Skynet obviously can't have every Terminator they create and send out on infiltration missions looking exactly alike. If they did, people would easily recognize them. Skynet's source for various likenesses are probably from either people they have captured and held in custody, or people they have encountered, killed, and/or fought out in the field. Tissue samples would be taken (for cloning, tissue cultivation, etc), visual images captured, and if possible, voice patterns and sound recorded. In a deleted scene from Terminator 3, Arnold's character is shown to be modeled on a military man, Sgt. William Candy who has a high voice and southern dialect. An official says \"I don't know about the voice,\" followed by another official, with Arnold's voice, who says: \"We can fix it.\" However, this idea is a later rationalization created by an author other than James Cameron and also not a consideration made at the time of the film's production. Also, as the scene was omitted from the final cut, it can not be considered canon. Another problem with this explanation is that it has been established in The Terminator and Terminator Salvation that early Terminators (e.g. T-600 units) had very obvious rubber skin. While this skin was surely shaped like a human face/body, it was likely similar to a generic rubber mask one might buy in a costume shop, and not intended to look like anyone specific (i.e., Arnold)."

    {
      "question": "Why is the Model 101 sometimes referred to as the T-800 or T-850?",
      "answer": "While \"Model 101\" is the official name of it as stated in the film series, some fans give the following as the explanation: The Series 800 Terminator is a type of Terminator mass produced by Skynet. Individual Terminators within the series are often referred to as T-800s. The Series 800 Terminators were the first in a line of Series 8xx Terminators in various timelines, including the Series 850 terminators. In the first two films, the Terminators sent back are \"Cyberdyne Systems series 800 model-101\", i.e. they are from the 800 series, model number 101. The model number referring to the physical appearance (i.e. Arnold), whereas the model 100 or 102 would look different from Arnold. As the future war progressed, Resistance fighters acquired more and more plasma weapons from destroyed battle units, captured factories, and uncovered warehouses. As a result, Skynet decided to harden the Series 800 Terminator against plasma attacks and add new features to aid in the destruction of mankind. The T-850s, from a physical perspective, are very similar to the T-800s, however there are extensive internal modifications in the T-850 line: Upgraded OS and file storage systems (including files on basic human psychology and behavior), toughened endoskeleton (more resistant to plasma weapon attacks), stronger joints and hydraulics, improved power cells (the compact nuclear-energy Iridium cell used by the T-800 were replaced by two hydrogen fuel cells in the Series 850 Terminator providing greater power and longer life), electronic adrenaline system, limited skin regeneration, faster reboot ability, data evaluation and predictive temporal event forecasting being just a few. Thus, the Series 850 Terminator is a far more dangerous threat than its predecessor, the Series 800 Terminator. On the box of the 1st Terminator VHS edition, you can see, in the left lens of the sunglasses, \"CSM101\", which probably stands for \"Cyberdyne Systems Model 101\", which is how the terminator in T2 refers to himself when he rescues John. An important thing to mention, in the Terminator 2 teaser trailer, during the making of the Arnold terminator, the screen reads, \"800 series model 101\". In the T2 deleted scene were Arnold is shut down and restarted, his HUD during the restart reads, \"series 800 model 101 version 2.4\". In the T3 extras, Arnold is refered to as an \"850 series model 101\". On a side note, there is a pattern of progression in Terminator series numbers, such as from 600 to 800 to 1000, multiples of 200, but nothing is known of \"hundreds\" series outside of these."

      "question": "Why didn't the large, intact piece of leg from the terminator seen landing on the ground in the factory (at the end of the first film) get taken away along with the arm and chip (seen at Cyberdyne)?",
      "answer": "Either it wasn't noticed and simply discarded as garbage/rubble, or it's an error/plothole on the part of the film makers. It is possible that all of the pieces of the terminator were collected by Cyberdyne for top secret research, but that the arm and the smashed chip were the only pieces worth keeping on display, as they were the pieces being studied. It's also possible that they ran tests, carbon dating; all sorts of things on the other pieces, causing them to be destroyed. But unless it was some sort of rare metal currently unheard of on the periodic table (which wouldn't necessarily make it radioactive), it was likely considered scrap."

      "question": "If the Connors try and stop Skynet, wouldn't this negate John's existence, as well as both the T-800's and T-1000's existence?",
      "answer": "Another headache paradox from the Terminator films. If John sent Kyle Reese back through time to become his father, then John's younger self and Sarah destroyed the building blocks of Skynet, then Skynet was erased from the timeline of the future. Therefore, there would be no reason to send Kyle Reese back in time and he would never meet Sarah and conceive John. In addition, if Skynet was destroyed this would also mean that they never developed any Terminators such as the T-800 and certainly not a more advanced Terminator such as the T-1000 which evidently was not even developed by Skynet until after the war had started. This theory was basically addressed in T3 by way of saying that Judgement Day was inevitable, therefore the events had to happen. However, at the time that James Cameron wrote T2, he intended it to be the end of the story. Since it is presently unknown how causality would resolve in the event of time paradoxes, it is conceivable that altering future events might not affect those in the present, even those resulting from recursive cause/effect scenarios."

      "answer": "The T-800's shotgun is a sawn-off Winchester model 1887. He never uses buckshot throughout the entire film, he only uses slugs in his iconic weapon. This is obvious for two reasons. (1) Every time he shoots the T-1000 with the shotgun it leaves a large singular hole instead of several small buckshot pellet holes. When he shoots the T-1000 at close range in the head with it, the blast splits the head in half as opposed to blowing it into chunks, which buckshot would do. (2) When the T-800 ejects the shells from the shotgun they are blue not red."

    {
      "question": "Can you really flip-cock a weapon that has a lever loop?",
      "answer": "Yes. In fact, the Winchester 1887 used by the terminator has an enlarged lever loop with a metal plate attached to it specifically made for better handling during flip-cocking. However, flip-cocking is still very tricky and even dangerous if not done correctly. It was noted by movie critics when T-2 was first released that the flip-cocking the Terminator does is an homage to a show called The Rifleman, which James Cameron or one or more of his writers might have watched as a kid. It's also used in one of John Wayne's earliest movies, Stagecoach (1939) by Wayne himself and again by Wayne in True Grit (1969).During the shoot, Arnold Schwarzenegger actually did injure his hand a few times when his skin got pinched in the mechanism. He had to practice quite a bit to master the technique without hurting himself."

      "question": "Why do we never see T-1000 models on the battlefield fighting the resistance in the opening scene at the beginning of the film, or any future battle sequences seen in any of the other films?",
      "answer": "The T-1000 model played by Robert Patrick is the only T-1000 model we see in the film. In the opening futuristic battle sequence we see an army of T-800 models as well as several other types of Skynet weaponry, such as aircraft fighters and tank-like machinery, fighting the resistance, but we never see any T-1000s fighting the resistance. There are three possible reasons for this. The first is that the battle sequence we see at the beginning might have been taking place before the T-1000 was ever created. The second is that the T-1000 in the film, while far more advanced, powerful, and durable, was still just a prototype and not ready for mass-production. The third, and most likely reason, is that the T-1000, unlike its predecessor, seems to have a limited emotional range. He is easily able to convince others that he is human: he smiles, can talk in modern day slang (as opposed to the T-800 who stills acts very robotic and uses words like \"affirmative\" and \"negative\" instead of saying yes or no) and conducts himself in the manner of a real police officer. In the clothing store he sees a mannequin that resembles his liquid metal form and seems somewhat surprised by its likeness to him. At the finale of the film, in the factory, Sarah shoots him several times with a shotgun. After he quickly recovers he wags his finger in a \"tsk tsk\" type fashion. Then, in perhaps the best example of his ability to show some emotional range, while torturing Sarah to call John out from hiding, he is thwarted in his interrogation by the T-800 who cuts him in half with a large metal rod. Previously in the film, The T-800 and T-1000 engaged in a small struggle in a mall while perusing John. The T-1000 throws the T-800 through a glass window, then immediately goes back to chasing John without bothering to see if the T-800 was capable of a quick recovery. However, after being stopped by the T-800 yet again, he seems to become extremely frustrated and proceeds to mercilessly beat the T-800, ripping off one of his limbs and impaling him with the metal rod until he is certain that the T-800 has been terminated and will not be able to hinder his objective anymore. He was unsuccessful in doing so, and in another display of an emotion, he exhibits a shocked expression when noticing the T-800 has come back, and after being shot with the grenade launcher which leads to his demise. The final point being that Skynet would not want to mass-produce a model that has the potential of thinking for itself in fear that their own creation might turn against them. Instead, they make a limited number of T-1000s for specific missions only, such as the mission of the T-1000 in this film to kill John Connor."

This cut included the alternate ending of the Ultimate Cut and some scenes of the Special Edition. The dream sequence where Sarah meets Kyle Reese is included while the punishment by the nurses is missing. But back to the basics. In 1993, a Special Edition of Terminator 2 was released that featured more than 15 minutes of new footage. Today this is probably the most common version. Some of the \"new\" scenes are Sarah's dream sequence, the \"learning upgrade\" of the T-800 and several other sequences. In total 18 scenes were added.

      "question": "Why does the T-1000 say \"I know this hurts\" to Sarah? It had already sampled her to imitate her.",
      "answer": "First, at a basic level, torture is a method of extracting information from a subject (victim) through use of pain and discomfort. The T-1000 probably said it to remind her that he could harm other parts of her body, perhaps even more painful areas, to get her to call John. Moments later, it extends another finger toward her eye as an even more menacing threat.Secondly, its chief purpose was to get Sarah to talk. In this film, Sarah is an angry and rebellious type who, though clearly frightened of what the T-1000 would do to her, wouldn't have any trouble spitting in the face of her enemy. Consequently, she says \"Fuck you!\" to the T-1000 allowing it to sample her voice."

The T-800 terminator was already famous for slaughtering an entire station full of police in 1984 and he had just opened fire on a Platoon of police with the minigun. While he didn't kill anyone, they would have assumed he was trying to. Sarah is an escaped mental patient known to have delusions of an apocalyptic future that she must prevent at any cost (having been shot and arrested for attempting to blow up a computer factory). John himself is a juvenile delinquent with a criminal record, last seen fleeing the galleria where a shootout ensued, resulting in the death of a mall employee. If they questioned Gibbons, the security guard that they tied up, he would have stated that Dyson was in on it with them. So it's possible they were ordered to shoot to kill, given the perceived history of the suspects. Also, when they stormed the room, they may have noticed Dyson holding the detonator to the explosives and didn't want to risk him setting them off, and so fired on him."

He needed the swat team to get close enough before he would die and drop his arm or warn them to get away, showing the urgency of the situation. One look at him and the SWAT team leader (Dean Norris) knew they had to evacuate, allowing the others more time to get away. He sacrificed himself to buy more time. The object he was holding was actually a piece of a model of the computer processor he was designing which he smashed with an axe in the extended cut. He used that to drop on to the actual detonator trigger.Dyson's plan was to blow up the Cyberdyne office, but didn't want to cause any casualties in the SWAT team. The office would get destroyed, but no innocent people got hurt. He likely knew he wasn't going to get out alive, but made sure none of the data in the office was going to be left behind for anyone to exploit."

    {
      "question": "The Terminator doesn't know why people cry, but at the end it does?",
      "answer": "Were they explicitly designed to mimic those two features? Sweating could be important for thermo regulation, which is what the human body uses it for, and halitosis could just be a by-product of having internal organs made out of metal. Now, one could argue that tear production would be helpful if, say, the Terminator got something in their eye or was in a particularly bad dust storm, but since the organic eyes themselves are only covering bionic eyes behind them, I don't think tears would be necessary. I dont think that line refers specifically to the act of crying, more to the emotion behind the tears. He's saying he can never cry out of sadness or joy, because he cannot feel those emotions. In the first movie, Kyle Reese said, \"The 600 series had rubber skin. We spotted them easy, but these are new. They look human... sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot. I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero on him.\" So I'd say yes, it was intentional or at least the most bizzare coincedence. I believe that by the word \"cry\" he means \"grieving.\" I.e. he can certainly mimic crying, but he can't feel sadness the way a human can. (of course, this is what marks Cameron as more \"advanced\" - as she is capable of at least simulating the emotion to herself) Uncle Bob understands why humans cry, but he cannot make himself grieve the way they can. The T-800 can't fake any emotion. Even humans have a hard time faking sadness and tears believably. Crying is not a common bodily function like sweating is so Skynet doesn't waste their time and resources creating that. He doesn't blush, cough, sneeze, bruise, drool, throw up, eat or go to the bathroom either. He sweats, he gets bad breath and he bleeds (a little), the bare minimum to pass for human. Even if T-800 can mimic tears, he's an emotionless machine. What he does isn't crying, or sweating, or having bad breath; it's a simulation of those things. He probably doesn't think of it as \"crying\" in the emotional sense that a human would, any more than he \"sweats\" in the way that a human would or has \"bad breath\" in the way a human would. To him, it's leaking fluid from his eyes, or releasing fluid through his skin, or exhaling with a scent that is displeasing to humans, and what does a robot care if its eyes or skin leak fluid, or when it exhales humans don't like the smell? Even if he can mimic them, he can't do them in a way a human can because he lacks the emotional and human connection to those concepts that humans have. Even if he can simulate the physical responses, he'll never be able to cry when a loved one dies, or if he ever holds a newborn baby, or if he steps on a Lego, because he lacks the ability to feel the emotional and physical responses that make humans cry in these situations. The \"something I can never do\" wasn't the crying, it was the feeling sad. As in, the reason why humans cry. The T-101 was, in effect, suggesting that John shouldn't grieve on its behalf, because it isn't capable of feeling sad about its own necessary destruction. Why else would it bring up the subject in the first place...? Terminators, even reprogrammed-to-be-friendly ones, don't make Non Sequitur comments: it was trying to fulfill its \"protect John from death or injury\" assignment right to the end, by attempting (in its socially-untutored way) to ease the boy's pain. And it did so indirectly, referencing their previous conversation, because it's learned from observing John and Sarah that humans (or at least those particular humans) tend not to state their feelings outright"

      "question": "Why did they put Gibbons in the men's bathroom, the most obvious place to look for him?",
      "answer": "The group was in a bit of a hurry and, simply put, hiding the security guard wasn't at the top at the list of priorities. Additionally, placing the security guard in the bathroom could've been for his benefit. As they were planning to blow the building up, leaving him in the bathroom would allow the group to simply stop by on their out. Also, restraining him around the toilet bowl would ensure he couldn't just yank the fixture out and escape."

      "question": "Wouldn't the T-800 Terminator have been better off leaving the T-1000 frozen in one piece? It would have taken longer for it to melt and regain the ability to move.",
      "answer": "Possibly. But shattering it and then letting it melt, then having to rebuild itself may have taken just as much time. The Terminator may have also hoped that it may cause some malfunction in the T-1000, which did happen if you watch the extended edition."

      "question": "Why didn't the T-800 just pick up the pieces of the T-1000 and run over to the vats of molten metal with them?",
      "answer": "He doesn't seem to notice the vats immediately, and even if he did, the solid pieces took about 50 seconds to completely thaw and reform. Carrying them closer to the heat source would only cause them to melt in Arnie's hands. Even if he started throwing the largest pieces to the vats, he couldn't get rid of more than a few percents of T-1000's total mass. Also, the T-800 probably didn't realize it might work as a way to destroy the T-1K.Additionally, the T-800's mission at that point was to protect John. Retreating and trying to hide bought them more valuable time to figure out a way to fight the T-1000."

      "answer": "The T-800 cant do anything to the T-1000. The T-1000 doesn't consider him a threat once his arm in crushed in the gear. In addition to that, by this point the T-1000 has developed an evil and nasty personality as explained by James Cameron:\"We saw the T-1000 as an advanced prototype, an experimental Terminator that could think and have a personality (...), which of course, the first Terminator could not do.\"The reason he left him there is vicious: he didn't want to finish him off, he wanted him to suffer and stay there knowing that he is helpless and stuck. The next time he encountered him he realized that he's like an annoying fly and took him out with ease"

      "question": "Was the T-1000 in agony while melting?",
      "answer": "Not at all. Of course, it can't be because it's an artificial being. The reason it acts that way while in the molten steel is because its systems are going berserk. Keep in mind this is not one machine, its thousands of nano machines working together. The heat was melting the structure causing disruptions in the system, making T-1000 move in every possible way. The T-1000 didn't know what to do, that's why he kept bringing up all the data he had, showing all the copied characters. According to James Cameron in T2 Extreme DVD audio commentary, it was looking for a workable solution. The noises it makes is not screaming or screeching in agony. Again, it's his damage vocal data.Novelization: It was screaming. A terrifying, inhuman siren of scream, as all its molecules were searching for the right channels back into its proper structure, but the intense heat and volubility of the molten metal around it confused them."

      "answer": "The T-1000 managed to track down Salceda Ranch and the very same night, right before going to Dyson's house, T-1000 arrived there and killed Enrique. There is an omitted but scripted and storyboarded scene of that. In his last ditch of effort, Enrique tries to kill T-1000 with a grenade, blowing his head off. The T-1000 then touches the head and reforms. The scene was also shown in T2: Cybernetic dawn comic book, which included creative input from Van Ling and Lightstorm Entertainment."

      "question": "Why did Terminator (Arnold) destroy himself at the end of the movie while the T-1000 was destroyed ?",
      "answer": "Because not completely being destroyed the first time was the reason the second T-800 had to come back and save John and Sarah. Skynet having the future technology is part of what leads them -- Myles Dyson's project -- to create the computer system that overtakes humanity in the present and eventually creates the various machines that will eliminate humans in the future. Removing any trace of that technology is the only hope of preventing another researcher like Miles Dyson from creating the very technology that will annihilate mankind. Right before the T-800 has Sarah lower it into the steel pit, it says \"There's one more chip\" and taps its head. It recognized that it needed to be destroyed."

      "question": "Why did the T-800 ask to be terminated? His mission was to ensure the survival of John Connor. Isn't that failing his mission?",
      "answer": "He does so to destroy all technology from the future that could lead to the development of Skynet, since the threat from the T-1000 was at an end. This would, in effect, be the greatest protection John could ever be afforded. Should Skynet pursue further assassination attempts to alter the time-line, the human resistance would most likely send a protector back in time to make sure the survival of the human resistance is not jeopardized; hence the release of Terminator 3, where the human resistance finds out a \"Terminatrix\" has been sent to destroy John's fellow lieutenants. Another protector, a T-850 model 101 terminator (this time reprogrammed by future Kate Brewster) is sent through time to defuse the threat against her life."

      "question": "Why does the T-1000 torture Sarah Connor in the steel mill?",
      "answer": "The T-1000 knows that in order to lure John out of hiding, he needs to put Sarah in danger, because John came to her rescue at the psychiatric hospital. Afterward, the T-1000 is then able to mimic Sarah just like he did with his other victims. In doing so, all he needed to do was call out John's name and let John see \"his mom\" hurting so he would go to her, therefore exposing himself to the T-1000. Luckily for John, the real Sarah was able to get back to him in time. Some consider this point in the story a plot hole, claiming the T-1000 did not imitate any of its earlier victims until they were dead. However, the T-800 explains that the T-1000 can mimic anything it samples merely via physical contact; it does not require the individual to be dead before it can take his/her form. The guard at the psychiatric hospital was sampled when he walked on the T-1000, who fully copied him before killing him. Sarah herself is sampled by the T-1000 during the torture scene. (Also, she might have been sampled in the elevator in Pescadero when the T-1000 is on top of the car, stabbing into it; one of those stabs slashes Sarah on the shoulder.) One can presume he was preparing to kill Sarah when the T-800 intervened, giving her time to escape. At that time, while torturing her, another objective the T-1000 might have had was to simply trick Sarah into speaking so it could sample her voice, another aspect to aide it in luring John to it.The T-1000's decreasing efficacy is explained in a few scenes cut from the theatrical version of the film but are able to be viewed as part of the director's cut or on most versions of the DVD as a deleted scene. After being frozen in the liquid nitrogen and then shattered, the T-1000 starts to show evidence that it may be malfunctioning. As it is walking, its feet, up to about the knee, involuntarily imitate the diamond plate flooring it walks across and its hand bonds with and imitates a yellow-striped railing. The T-1000 itself seems confused by this but is unable to stop it. Later, when it calls John in Sarah's voice, the glitch occurs again: John glances down, and there's a quick shot of the T-1000 imitating the grating its standing on right before Sarah shoots it the 1st time. In the theatrical version, the only evidence of the glitch is the slight flutter that you see after it crushes Arnold's arm in the gear. This may explain why it moves much more slowly during the final conflict, which allows Sarah to escape while it is dealing with the T-800."

    {
      "question": "What was happening to the T-1000 near the end of the film?",
      "answer": "The T-1000 is frozen solid in the accident with the CryoCo semi-truck, then broken into pieces by a bullet from the T-800's gun. Although the heat from the steel mill allows him to melt and regenerate, this incident damaged the T-1000 considerably. He begins to malfunction, first noticing this when his hand begins to meld with a steel bar against his will. He quickly starts losing control of his mimetic processes and begins to inadvertently emulate everything he comes into contact with. He is able to take on Sarah Connor's appearance to try to lure John, but his identity is quickly given away when John notices that his feet meld to the metal flooring, again, against his will. This may also be a factor in why the T-1000 was finally finished off by a grenade fired into his stomach by the T-800, which damaged him to the point of not being able to regenerate fast enough before stumbling into the liquid steel, killing him. As pointed out before, while the T-1000 is technically a superior model, he is still just a prototype, and is possibly not up to date enough to be able to fully recover from an incident like that."
