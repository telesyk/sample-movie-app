      "question": "Mary Martin originated the role on Broadway; was she considered for the movie?",
      "answer": "By all reports, no, she was never considered, but probably for good reason. Martin hadn't made a movie since the early 50s and was very open about not liking to work in film, preferring the stage and live TV. But another reason is that when Martin first appeared as Maria, she was already in her 40s. By the time the movie entered production, Martin was now over 50 and couldn't have convincingly played the young, virginal Maria on film."

      "question": "Why did Rolfe join the Nazis?",
      "answer": "Near the end of the film it is discovered that Rolfe the telegram delivery boy has joined the Nazi regime and aids them in tracking Captain Von Trapp and his family. Many question as to why his motives changed and why he joined the Third Reich as it seems very unexpected for his character.Since the beginning of the film it is hinted that Rolfe is a Nazi supporter and is a member of the party. As he has much information of their activities and their plans. As he almost tells Liesl about the upcoming invasion of Austria when they talk about her father's staunch Austrian beliefs. He also almost tells her that a high ranking Nazi officer is in Austria, he would not get such info unless he was a member of the Nazi regime.Another scene is when Rolfe goes to the Von Trapp house with the telegram for Captain Georg Von Trapp. Their butler Franz asks Rolfe is there were any developments, as he shuts the door behind him. It is implied that Rolfe would pass info to Franz regarding the Nazi's activities in Austria. Since it is later revealed that Franz is also a member of the Nazi Party as he is seen watching the family escape the villa wearing a nazi eagle pin with a swastika on it.The confirmation to his support is when he tells the Captain himself Heil Hitler, and does the salute after trying to cover up the fact that he was looking for Liesl since he was throwing stones at her window to get her attention.Up till this point Rolfe has only supported the Nazis, however by the end of the film it is reviled that he is now a full fledged Nazi soldier trying to track down the Captain and his family, and force him into the German Navy. His change in character most likely came from the new Gauleiter Herr Zeller, who most likely convinced him to become a soldier, and help track down the family. Since Rolfe was close to them and could help them find Captain.It is also hinted that Rolfe is very insecure in who he is, as throughout the film he lacks confidence with both the Captain and almost everyone else he comes in contact with. The only person he is truly confident with is Liesl since she has the same affection for him as he does for her. He wants to stand out from everyone else and feel important. Since when Captain take his pistol away he bows his head in distress, and realizes he cannot bring himself to kill Captain and realizes he has been exposed. Until the Captain angers him by telling \"he will never be one of them.\" in which he betrays them and alerts the rest of the crew.While some do not catch on quickly, it is quite obvious that Rolfe was a Nazi sympathizer, and supporter of the party since the beginning of the film, and it only progressed throughout the story."
