      "question": "Why did Marion become a prostitiute?",
      "answer": "Although Marion does not become a full-time prostitute, we see Marion sell her body three times throughout the movie to feed her addiction; once with her shrink, once with Big Tim, and finally in the ass-to-ass scene at Big Tim's party. It's a very safe conclusion, however, that she would go back to Big Tim as needed for more drugs-- and with Big Tim, her body is the ultimate currency."

      "question": "Why did that happen to Harry?",

    {
      "question": "What's the significance of each character's final scene?",
      "answer": "Harry, Marion, Tyrone and finally Sara are each shown curling into a fetal position for their final scene; a symbol of how their lives have been lost in complete ruin and despair. Harry and Tyrone are in prison, with Tyrone subject to hard work detail under harsh supervision by racist guards, and Harry's arm amputated at the shoulder; Marion has a new regular drug supplier, but she must pay for her drugs through sexual favors, and Sara is trapped in her psychosis-induced world of appearing on the Tappy Tibbons infomercial and presenting a successful, engaged Harry to an adoring audience.By seeing all the characters being in a fetal position can be interpreted as a metaphor for how helpless they all are. It also makes the viewers realize what drug can do to you and how helpless you can get. So the moral of the movie is nothing else than: Don't do drugs."
