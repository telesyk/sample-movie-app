      "content": "This is the breakout role for Sigourney (n√©e Susan) Weaver, whose iconic presence still propels this ride beyond the scores of substandard imitations that followed. Why see it on the big screen? Because it's bloody brilliant."

      "rate": "90",
      "content": "Despite years of imitators, sequels (some great, some not so), and edited-for-television broadcasts, Alien has lost none of its power, and the big screen only intensifies its impact."

      "rate": "88",
      "content": "The most important features of this \"new\" version are the digital cleaning of the print and the re-mastering of the sound. There are a few added scenes, but they are mostly insignificant and have been previously seen (at least by fans of the movie) on the laserdisc or DVD releases."

      "rate": "88",
      "content": "Alien, even with some scene tinkering that has left this \"director's cut\" one minute shorter than its original release, is still one of the creepiest, scariest, most shocking films ever."
