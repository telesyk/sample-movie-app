      "question": "What's the difference between the theatrical release version and the director's cut version?",
      "answer": "By most accounts, there doesn't seem to be any reputable source confirming a 'Director's Cut' actually exists. There have been rumors of one, but per the documentary \"Rocky: An American Hero\", all the outtake footage from \"Rocky\" is gone (it was incinerated in the 80's), so it is unlikely that we will see one at this point."

All together, Gazzo gives Rocky a total of $570 on-camera during the movie. In real life, Joe Spinell (who played Gazzo) actually gave Sylvester Stallone money out of his own pocket so Stallone could buy gas for his car or buy food for himself when he was a struggling actor during the early and mid 1970s much like Gazzo does with Rocky in this film."

      "question": "Was this the first film to use the Steadicam?",
      "answer": "No. invented the Steadicam (originally called the Brown Stabilizer) in 1975. The first film production on which it was used was Hal Ashby's Bound for Glory (1976), where it was used at the behest of cinematographer Haskell Wexler. However the first film to be released which featured the Steadicam was John Schlesinger's Marathon Man (1976), where, again, it was used by request of cinematographer Conrad L. Hall. Rocky was both the third film on which it was used and the third film released, although people often make the mistake that Rocky originated the use of the device. This is most likely because of the fame of Rocky as opposed to the other two films (even though Bound for Glory won Best Cinematography at the Oscars). Additionally, the shots in Rocky which employ the Steadicam are all iconic shots, especially the Philadelphia Museum shot, and this extra fame has no doubt contributed to people erroneously believing it to be the first film to feature the Steadicam.

As the press looms in to interview him, Rocky's only reply is to call out for Adrian. In the wings, Andrian calls for Rocky and tries to make her way through the crowd. In a split decision, Creed is named the winner. In the final scene, Adrian reaches the ring, throws her arms around Rocky, and they both declare their love for each other."
