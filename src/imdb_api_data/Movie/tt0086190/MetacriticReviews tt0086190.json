      "content": "Cuteness is the watchword here. The dark, eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is gone. Instead, for Return of the Jedi, we have good triumphing decisively over evil, a too-pat resolution to a love triangle, and walking teddy bears."

      "content": "The dialogue is repetitive (\"I won't give in to the dark side of the Force!\" \"You will!\") and significant characters from earlier films -- notably bounty hunter Boba Fett and Yoda -- are dispatched without fanfare, and the whole business has a slightly rushed, perfunctory feel at the same time that it feels oddly attenuated."

      "rate": "70",
      "content": "Brings things to an almost cheesy conclusion. Given the gripping, dark elements that creator George Lucas introduced in the two previous films, the third movieÂ’s outcome smacks of PG-rated populism rather than artistic fulfillment. But the experience is still highly entertaining. [Special Edition]"

      "content": "Ultimately, Jedi even backs off some of the more tantalizing possibilities suggested by the cliffhanging scenario of \"Empire.\" This inhibition appears to grow out of consideration for the feelings of the juvenile audience, which can enjoy an abundance of thrills and close calls while resting assured that nothing catastrophic is going to be fall the heroes."
