      "question": "In which Middle Eastern country is the film set?",
      "answer": "This was deliberately left ambiguous by the filmmakers. The film was shot in Amman, Jordan, but the story's conflict between Christian and Muslim militias would seem to imply the setting is Lebanon during and after the Lebanese Civil War (1975-1990). Some viewers have noted that the word \"Palestine\" can be seen on an office window during one scene. However, this sign is clearly part of the slogan \"I <3 Palestine\" and does not mean the film is supposed to be set there, but that the student newspaper is in favour of the Palestinian liberation and probably PLO which was taking part in the Lebanese Civil War."
