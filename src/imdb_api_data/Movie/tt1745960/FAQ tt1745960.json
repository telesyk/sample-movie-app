      "question": "What is the strange-looking black-colored aircraft Maverick is test-piloting at the start of the film?",
      "answer": "The aircraft is a fictional design called the Darkstar Hypersonic aircraft. It's design was inspired by the Lockheed Martin SR-72 (the proposed successor to the famous SR-71 Blackbird). Aircraft designers from Lockheed Martin's Skunkworks group aided the film's designers in realising the design."

      "question": "Is it realistic that Maverick would still be in the Navy on active duty as a captain (O6) 36 years after the events of this first film?",
      "answer": "No, it isn't. To have been a proficient enough F-14 aviator for TOPGUN in 1986, Maverick would have to have been approximately 28 years old with at least six years of service by the time of the first film. That would put him past 40 years of service by the events of the second film, not merely \"over 30\" as the film suggests. The military has been on an \"up-or-out\" promotion system since the 1950s. Maverick's peers still in the service, such as Iceman, have all made admiral. Once Maverick had been passed over rear admiral the second time (which would have happened in roughly 2010) he would have been processed for involuntary retirement.The film works around this by suggesting that Iceman has been Maverick's guardian angel. Due to Mav's unparalleled skill and experience, the Navy has somewhat made an exception for his lack of moving up the ranks. Despite each of his commanders very much wanting him gone."

      "question": "If the Navy could use tomahawk missiles to destroy the enemy airstrip, why didn't they also use them to destroy the enemy missile sites?",
      "answer": "Because the enemy missile sites had counter-measures."

    {
      "question": "How could Maverick survive ejecting sit from Darkstar hypersonic aircraft while in the heights of Mach 10.2 speed?",
      "answer": "In the novel; \"The Man Who Rode the Thunder\" by William H. Ranking. The author ejected at high speed above a Thunder Cloud and survived the 35 minute decent, you can make you own judgement. Maverick can also be seen quickly throttling back before the scene cuts."

      "question": "How realistic was the mission portrayed in the film?",
      "answer": "While very entertaining to watch, there were several issues with the way the mission was planned and executed that would likely have played out very differently in real life. In the film, Maverick assesses the operational problem based on a quick survey of some photos and determines the method for destroying the target almost instantly. In real life, an entire cell of joint planners would analyze the problem for days if not weeks and come up with multiple courses of action that could achieve the goal, and the decider for a target such as this would probably be the President (since the enemy is very clearly supposed to be Iran). Maverick airily assumes away the stealth capability of the F-35 (as well as Air Force assets such as the B-2), and immediately assesses the job can only be done by F/A-18s for reasons unexplained. There is no discussion of using electronic warfare aircraft and/or cyber attack to shut down or at least hinder the enemy's integrated air defense system. The Navy uses cruise missiles to strike an enemy airfield to keep additional enemy fighters from taking off but does not seem to consider striking the enemy surface-to-air missile systems, radars, and command-and-control nodes by the same method. There is no combat air patrol (CAP) of F-35s to engage enemy fighters and protect the strike aircraft on egress from the target (even if we agree with the basic assumption that F/A-18s were necessary for the strike, F-35s, not more F/A-18s would be the clear choice for the CAP). There is no reason why the strike aircraft would be loaded exclusively with flare countermeasures instead of chaff when the threat was clearly understood to be radar-guided weapons. Finally, the strike aircraft were loaded out with laser-guided bombs requiring a diving delivery, high-G pulloff, and spotting of the target with a laser from the wingman; GPS-guided munitions could have hit the target with a higher probability of success and lower-risk level delivery over the target. All of the above issues added more drama and action onscreen but also severely eroded the military realism."

      "question": "Did Val Kilmer's actual cancer diagnosis contribute to Iceman getting killed off in this film?",
      "answer": "Something like that, yes. It was beautiful how they handled Kilmer's actual illness in the movie. It was expected that Iceman might not live much longer in the movie, specifically when Maverick meets his distressed wife when he comes to visit Iceman. If Kilmer didn't have cancer, he might have been a regular character in the movie with a longer role."
