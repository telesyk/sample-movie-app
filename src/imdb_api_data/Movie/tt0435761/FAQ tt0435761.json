Desperate to get back to Andy, Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) and his gang plot to escape. Edit"

      "question": "Is the 'Toy Story' series based on a book?",
      "answer": "The Toy Story series grew from an early script co-written by Pixar film-makers John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter in an attempt to create a movie based totally on computer-generated animation. When the first movie, (1995), proved to be highly successful, it was followed by Toy Story 2 (1999) (1999) and Toy Story 3. The screenplay for Toy Story 3 was written by American screenwriter Michael Arndt based on a story by Lasseter, Stanton, and Lee Unkrich (who also directed the movie). Toy Story 4 (2019) is planned for release in 2019. Edit"

    {
      "question": "How many of the toys from the first two movies appear in this movie?",
      "answer": "The original Andy toys that appear in this film are Woody, Buzz (voice of ), Rex (voice of Wallace Shawn), the Potato Heads (voices of Don Rickles and Estelle Harris), Hamm (voice of John Ratzenberger), and Slinky (voice of Blake Clark). They are joined by Jessie (voice of Joan Cusack), Bullseye the horse, the three aliens from the Pizza Planet truck, and Barbie (voice of Jodi Benson). Sarge (voice of R. Lee Ermey) also makes an appearance at the beginning, leaping out of Andy's bedroom window with some Army men, explaining to Woody that Army men are the first to get thrown away. Bo Peep and a lot of the original toys also make an appearance in the beginning of the film. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "What happened to the other toys, such as Wheezy and Bo Peep?",
      "answer": "Woody mentions that all the other old toys have moved on to new owners, suggesting they were either passed on or sold at yard sales. At the mention of Bo Peep, Woody sounds particularly depressed, hinting at their romantic relationship shown in the previous films."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why was Bo Peep not included in 'Toy Story 3?'",
      "answer": "Bo Peep does appear briefly in the film, in the early scenes showing older home video of a younger Andy playing with his toys. In truth, Bo Peep was not a toy, but part of a porcelain lamp (along with three sheep) that belonged to Andy's younger sister, Molly. Though Andy incorporated Bo Peep into his playtimes, she was more of a nursery lamp. In The Art of Toy Story 3 book, Director Lee Unkrich explained that, since the lamp was originally for Molly, he couldn't see Andy being attached or wanting a nursery school lamp. So, Bo Peep became one of the many unseen 'casualties' of kids growing up. She was given away in a yard sale."

    {
      "question": "I heard that Andy's old neighbor Sid is supposed to be in 'Toy Story 3'. Is this true?",
      "answer": "Sid is the garbage man that services Andy's neighborhood. If you watch the garbage man picking up the family's trash, he is wearing a skull shirt just like Sid wore in the first Toy Story. He is also voiced by the same actor, , who voiced Sid in the first film. This is confirmed on an interview about the movie with director Lee Unkrich and producer Darla K. Anderson. Edit"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Sid tie Lotso to the front of his garbage truck?",
      "answer": "No, the man who ties Lotso to the front of his garbage truck is a different garbage man (made obvious by his appearance and his voice)."

      "question": "What did Woody write on the Post-It note that he put on the box of toys?",
      "answer": "He wrote Bonnie's address. It's visible for a few frames if paused at the right moment."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "The toys escape from the incinerator, thanks to the Aliens' use of \"the claw.\" They board a dump truck that takes them back to Andy's room where they assemble in the box marked \"Attic\". As an afterthought, Woody puts on the box a post-it note with the address of 6-year-old Bonnie (voice of ). As he is driving away to college, Andy delivers the box to Bonnie and introduces her to each of the toys. Before continuing on, Andy plays with Bonnie, but he finally must leave. As Andy drives away, Woody sadly says, \"So long, pardner.\" In the final scene, Woody begins to introduce Andy's toys to Bonnie's toys. Edit"

    {
      "question": "What happens in the Spanish version of the film during Buzz's \"Spanish mode\"?",
      "answer": "In the Spanish versions of the film, during Buzz Lightyear's \"Spanish mode\", he continues to speak Spanish rather than a different language such as English. However, different accents and dialects are used depending on the region. In the Latin American version, \"normal\" Buzz uses the local Latin American variety of Spanish in the dubbed version, but when he converts to \"Spanish mode\", he shifts to the \"standard\" Castilian accent (from central Spain), which to native speakers, sounds very different from Latin American Spanish. In Spain, \"normal\" Buzz uses standard Castilian Spanish in the dubbed version, and when he converts to Spanish mode, he then uses an exaggerated Andalusian accent from southern Spain, which is appropriately the land of flamenco and many other traditions identified as stereotypically Spanish. Woody even responds to him with a mock imitation of this Andalusian accent. In that way, the basic premise of the joke is retained or even enhanced in the Spanish dubbed versions."

      "question": "Is it true that there was a completely different version of 'Toy Story 3' being developed without Pixar?",
      "answer": "In 2004, Disney and Pixar signed an agreement that all characters created by Pixar for their films are owned by Disney. Furthermore, Disney retains the rights to make sequels to any Pixar film, though Pixar retains the right of first refusal to work on these sequels. Disney took advantage of this and started production on an entirely different Toy Story 3 with a new division of animation called \"Circle 7 Animation\" without any involvement with Pixar. The division wrote a script that focused on the Buzz Lightyear toy being recalled because of a malfunction. The company that manufactured him say that they will ship the toys back to Taiwan where they will be fixed. Consequenty, Buzz is shipped off to Taiwan. The other toys then find out that they are completely replacing and disposing the other Buzz Lightyears and sending back brand new ones as opposed to fixing the old ones. The toys then ship themselves to Taiwan to save him. Meanwhile, Buzz meets toys who were once loved but now thrown out. This script was written by Jim Herzfeld for Circle 7. The script was completed and production was ready and Tim Allen indicated a willingness to participate even if Pixar was not involved. However, shortly afterwards in January 2006, Disney bought Pixar in a deal that put Pixar chiefs Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter in charge of all Disney Animation. Shortly thereafter, Circle 7 Animation was completely shut down and its version of Toy Story 3 was shelved. The character designs went into the Disney archives. Some animators from Circle 7 were transferred to Pixar where the version of Toy Story 3 we see today began. However, Disney still has the right to use Pixar characters without Pixar's involvement."

      "question": "Why are there posters of 'Toy Story 3' with captions that say \"Not since...\" floating around the internet?",
      "answer": "The \"Not since...\" Toy Story 3 campaign was a campaign to win the Best Picture award at the 2011 Oscars. In these posters, Toy Story 3 was compared with a past Best Picture winner at the Oscars. They usually choose films that were unlikely to win Best Picture but won anyway, such as Silence of the Lambs or Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. They would then choose a still from Toy Story 3 that somehow related to that film they were comparing it to, for example, when they were comparing the film to Silence of the Lambs, they would show a still of a dismembered Potato-head under the caption \"Not since Silence of the Lambs...\". At the bottom of the poster, they would also point out that it was the best reviewed film of the year (which it was). Although the campaign got plenty of attention, Toy Story 3 failed to win best picture."

      "question": "Any recommendations for other Pixar movies?",
      "answer": "If you like Pixar's animation in Toy Story 3, you'll certainly want to see some of the other Pixar productions, including the first two Toy Story movies, and perhaps (1998), Monsters, Inc. (2001) (2001), Finding Nemo (2003) (2003), The Incredibles (2004) (2004), Cars (2006) (2006) and Cars 2 (2011) (2011), Ratatouille (2007) (2007), WALL·E (2008) (2008), Up (2009) (2009), Brave (2012) (2012), and Finding Dory (2016).

    {
      "question": "Are there any classic Pixar easter eggs that reference the old films?",
      "answer": "Yes. The Pizza Planet truck makes a very clear appearance in a flashback scene (Lotso, Big Baby, and Chuckles ride on its bumper on the way to Sunnydale). The Pixar staple \"A113\" also appears as Andy's mom's license plate, as it did in the first two films. A lot of the dialogue in the beginning of the film is the dialogue Andy said as he was playing with the toys in the beginning of the first film (ex: \"I brought my dog with built in force field, well I brought my dinosaur who eats force field dogs\"). Andy's room has a few car posters that are supposedly a hint of new characters for . Buzz Lightyear's batteries are BnL (Buy N Large) brands from WALL·E (2008). Lightning McQueen from Cars (2006) can be seen in the background behind one of the children in the Butterfly room, although in the form of a toy soapbox car rather than a miniature replica. Again, during the Butterfly room introduction, Mr. Ray from Finding Nemo (2003) can be spotted on the shelf next to a blue whale and dolphin, in front of one orange and one green bin. Another shot of Mr. Ray can be seen when Buzz and the robot shakes hands. Nemo himself can be spotted around Sunnyside in the form of drawings. Edit"
