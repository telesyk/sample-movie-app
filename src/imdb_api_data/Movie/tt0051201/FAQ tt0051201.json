The screenplay for the movie was written by Larry Marcus, Harry Kurnitz, and Billy Wilder (who also directed the movie). A TV remake, also titled , was released in 1982. Edit"

      "question": "What was Sir Wilfrid trying to do with his monocle?",
      "answer": "Charles Laughton modeled his characterization of Sir Wilfrid Roberts on Florance Guedella, an English lawyer who was famous for twirling his monocle while cross-examining witnesses. Sir Wilfried apparently uses his monocle as a sort of lie detector. The logic seems to be that if the person being cross-examined can maintain his or her composure while the monocle reflects light in his eyes, he's probably telling the truth and is therefore worth defending. The latter would probably be difficult, and its effectiveness as a lie detector seems highly dubious. The original lawyer probably just used this technique on unfriendly witnesses to distract them, making their testimony sound less certain. That's assuming it wasn't merely a habit with no ulterior purpose."

      "question": "How closely does the movie follow the short story?",
      "answer": "Outside of a few name changes (e.g., Christine of the movie is called Romaine in the story), the biggest difference is in the ending, which does not involve any mention of perjury. Actually, it was Agatha Christie who made this change when adapting the story for her play. Christie grew dissatisfied with this ending (one of the few Christie endings in which a murderer escapes punishment), and, in her subsequent rewriting of the story as a play, added a mistress for Leonard Vole and the twist ending that appears in the movie. The biggest difference between the movie and the story/play is the addition of Sir Wilfred's nurse, Miss Plimsoll (). Lanchester and Laughton were actually married to each other at the time. Edit"
