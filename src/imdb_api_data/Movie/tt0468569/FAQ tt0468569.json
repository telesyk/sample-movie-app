      "question": "Who created the character of Batman? Bob Kane is listed in old (pre-2015) media including the comic books as creating Batman on his own but new media (made after 2015) shows him as co-creating the character with someone called Bill Finger, so what's all that about?",
      "answer": "It's a long story so here goes....After the success of the comic book Superhero Superman, artist tried to come up with his own hero \"The Bat-Man\", the character Kane created wore a red suit with a domino mask, blonde hair and a pair of bat wings. Kane then asked for writer Bill Finger's assistance on the project. Finger rejected several of Kane's initial ideas about the character and suggested several changes in design and characterization. His changes included changing his hair colour, a black colour scheme for the costume, adding a cape and cowl, the idea that he shouldn't have any superpowers, his civilian identity of Bruce Wayne (which Finger named after Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland and general Anthony \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne), the origin story about his parents being shot in an alley and the idea that he should also be a detective.Kane marketed the \"Batman\" character to National Comics, and Batman's first story was published in \"Detective Comics\" #27 (May 1939). The script was written by an uncredited Finger, making him the first of many ghost writers to work on comics officially credited to Bob Kane. When Kane negotiated a contract about selling the rights to the \"Batman\" character, he claimed he was the sole creator and demanded a sole mandatory byline acknowledging him as such on all comics and adaptations. Out of fairness, Kane agreed to pay Finger his share with money out of his earnings. Unfortunately, the agreement was never put into writing, and Finger never saw a cent.Finger would go on to ghost write Batman stories up into the mid 1960's, either with Kane or for DC Comics directly. During his writing tenure, Finger was responsible for the unaccredited creation of many key players and pieces in the Batman universe.These included the Batmobile, the Batcave, Gotham City, and Batman's nickname \"The Dark Knight\". He also came up with several secondary Batman characters including, his sidekick Robin, his arch-nemesis The Joker, and his occasional love interest Catwoman, as well as Commissioner Gordon, The Riddler and The Scarecrow. Despite all of this, the only writing credit that Finger received for Batman in his lifetime were two episodes of Batman (1966), The Clock King's Crazy Crimes (1966) and The Clock King Gets Crowned (1966) which he co-wrote with friend Charles Sinclair.Eventually, the truth did come out. Finger attended the first official New York Comic Con in 1965 and sat on a panel with other comic book creators where he revealed the role he played in Batman's creation. Finger's story gained exposure in a two-page article titled \"If the truth be known, or a Finger in every plot!,\" written and distributed by pop culturist Jerry Bails. Kane caught wind of Finger's appearance not long after and replied in the form of a printed letter to Batman fan magazine, \"Batmania,\" where he labeled his old friend a fraud. Finger, who by this time was deeply in debt, continued to write for various projects in and outside of comic books until his death in 1974, when he was found alone in his apartment by friend Charles Sinclair. Finger died penniless and his contributions to the character was never acknowledged in his lifetime.However, after the popularity of Tim Burton's Batman (1989), Kane acknowledged Finger as \"a contributing force\" in the character's creation, and wrote in his 1989 autobiography \"Batman and Me\" that \"Now that my long-time friend and collaborator is gone, I must admit that Bill never received the fame and recognition he deserved. He was an unsung hero ... I often tell my wife, if I could go back fifteen years, before he died, I would like to say. 'I'll put your name on it now. You deserve it.'\"Many failed attempts were made over the years by Finger's family to get him recognition for his work, including a request from his second wife Lyn Simmons to have his name listed in the credits of Tim Burton's Batman (1989).Finger remained largely unknown, even to Batman fans, until writer Marc Tyler Nobleman began investigating the late author's life for a book being written about him called \"Bill the Boy Wonder: The Secret Co-Creator of Batman\". Nobleman went in search of Finger's family to help fill in the gaps and give him credit. While Finger's autopsy report claimed no relatives were present, Nobleman discovered that Finger had a son, Fred.Unfortunately, Fred, who was an outspoken proponent of his father, had died in 1992. Nobleman learned that Fred was also homosexual, leading him to believe that Fred had no children before his death. The trail was starting to go cold.However, after receiving new information from Finger's nephew, Nobleman discovered Fred indeed had a daughter, Athena Finger, who was born two years after Finger's death. Nobleman met with Athena and convinced her to meet with DC about getting recognition for her grandfather. DC in turn welcomed Athena with open arms, cut her a check and invited her to the premiere of The Dark Knight (2008) with all expenses paid. It wasn't until around 2012 that DC offered her more money. This time, however, she had to sign away her rights to her grandfather's claim. With encouragement from Nobleman, Athena rejected the money and took DC to court.It took years of litigation before a settlement was reached. A major turning point in the case was the unearthing of recorded interviews with Bob Kane during the writing of his autobiography. During one of the interviews, Tom Andrae, Kane's co-writer, asked Kane to what extent Finger contributed to Batman's creation. \"Bill was responsible for 50 to 75 percent,\" Kane bluntly responded.Finally, in September 2015, DC Entertainment issued a statement informing the public that Finger would be listed as co-creator on any piece of Batman media henceforth. Starting with the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and the second season of Gotham (2014), an updated acknowledgement for the character appeared as \"Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger\".Finger's story was later used as the subject of the Hulu original documentary, Batman & Bill (2017).

      "question": "Which characters were adapted from the Batman comic books?",
      "answer": "Note: For this list only the creators of the characters first appearances are listed. As with all comic book characters, Batman and his supporting cast have had several reinventions and different contributions from different writers. Theses include different iterations in different mediums that all have added different concepts to the overall mythology of the characters.Obviously there's Bruce Thomas Wayne/Batman called only Bruce Wayne or Batman on screen. He made his first appearance in the comic story \"The Case of the Chemical Syndicate\" from Detective Comics #27 (May, 1939) by writer and artist Bob Kane.The Joker, who made his first appearance in the comic story \"The Joker\" from Batman #1 (Spring 1940) by writer Bill Finger, artist Bob Kane from a concept by illustrator Jerry Robinson.Harvey Dent/Two-Face, who made his first appearance in the comic story \"The Crimes Of Two-Face\" (as Harvey Kent) from Detective Comics #66 (August 1942) by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane.Alfred, the butler, whose full name in the comics is Alfred Thaddeus Crane Pennyworth. In his first comic appearances he was called Alfred Beagle and first appeared in the comic story \"Here Comes Alfred\" from Batman #16 (April-May 1943) by writer Don Cameron and artist Bob Kane. The characters were later reintroduced as Alfred Pennyworth (complete with a different appearance) in comics continuity by writer Bill Finger and artist Jerry Robinson.Gotham City Police Lieutenant, later promoted to Commissioner, James Worthington Gordon, Sr., called Commissioner Gordon or Jim on screen. Just like Batman, he made his first appearance in the comic story \"The Case of the Chemical Syndicate\" from Detective Comics #27 (May 1939) by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane.Lucius Fox, who made his first appearance in the comic story \"Dark Messenger of Mercy\" from Batman #307 (January 1979) and was created by writer Len Wein and artist John Calnan.Dr Jonathan Crane/The Scarecrow, who made his first appearance in the comic story \"Riddle of the Human Scarecrow\" from World's Finest Comics #3 (Fall 1941) by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane.Crime Boss Maroni, whose full name is Salvatore Vincent 'Sal' \"The Boss\" Maroni, who made his first appearance in the comic story \"The Crimes Of Two-Face\" from Detective Comics #66 (August 1942) by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane.Gotham City Police Commissioner Gillian B.

In the comics she would end up becoming Batman's ally in his war against crime as Batgirl and then as Oracle. She was originally created by Batman Editor Julius Schwartz, and artist Carmine Infantino at the request of the producer of Batman (1966) William Dozier. She was later adapted into the comics starting the comic story \"The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!\" by writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino.and James Gordon, Jr., Gordon's son, he first appeared \"Year One (Part IV of IV): Friend in Need\" from Batman #407 by writer Frank Miller and artist David Mazzucchelli.All other characters were created by the films writers for this movie.

    {
      "question": "Why isn't there a \"Batman\" in the title?",
      "answer": "Director Christopher Nolan told Mean Magazine he wants to do something different from Batman Begins, his first film in the series. The title is a way of telling the public as much. It also distances the film from Saturday morning cartoons, the campy 1960s TV series and the Burton/Schumacher movies of the 1990s. In fact, this will be the first Batman movie not to have \"Batman\" in the title. Nolan said the title was carefully chosen. It certainly has precedent. \"The Dark Knight\" is a title first bestowed upon Batman in the comic book Batman #1 (Spring, 1940). Frank Miller, whose work inspired Nolan in Batman Begins, also used the term for his 1986 comic book mini-series, Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. Moreover, Harvey Dent is known in the film as \"The White Knight\", which adds a touch of irony to the title. The title prepares us for the grim tone of the film. It is reinforced in a quotation from the trailer: \"The night is darkest before the dawn.\""

      "question": "How soon after the ending of \"Batman Begins\" does \"The Dark Knight\" take place?",
      "answer": "At the end of Batman Begins, the Joker made his first appearance, off screen, when then-Lieutenant Gordon tells Batman about a robbery the Joker committed. In one of the Gotham Tonight videos released to promote The Dark Knight, it is stated that the attack on the Narrows which took place toward the end of Batman Begins happened nine months previously. The Joker has committed several crimes during that time. He is known to the police, to Batman, and to the mob. None of them think he is anybody to be worried about or taken seriously. Then he begins his reign of terror in The Dark Knight."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the Joker differ from previous on-screen portrayals?",
      "answer": "In Tim Burton's (1989), Jack Nicholson gave the public a grimmer, scarier Joker than what it had known before. Until then, the public's idea of the Joker had been Cesar Romero, one of the guest villains in the campy 1960s TV series Batman (1966). Heath Ledger based his Joker on Alex DeLarge from A Clockwork Orange (1971) (1971), which wipes away any thought of Romero. Publicity photos show him with the sides of his mouth cut, giving him an unnaturally wide grin. The mutilated mouth links him to Conrad Veidt who played Gwynplaine, the clown with the carved smile, in The Man Who Laughs (1928) (1928). Bob Kane and Bill Finger had thought of the grinning Veidt when they created the Joker. Nolan continues the trend by making the Joker more sinister and less pranksterish than ever. The new Joker is a brutal killer with a macabre and malicious sense of humor. Also, this Joker's skin and hair color is because of makeup (described as warpaint in the movie) and hair dye, not his actual skin and hair color caused by a chemical accident. Edit"

Only at the end does Bruce Wayne fire Mr. Earle and hire Lucius as CEO. Lucius appeared in both Batman animated series in the 1990s. Around the time that The Dark Knight came out, he was appearing in the the later seasons of the 2000s' animated series called . He did not appear in any of the four Burton/Schumacher Batman films.

He reprises this role in a cameo in The Dark Knight Rises (2012)."

    {
      "question": "Where is Gotham City located?",
      "answer": "Gotham City is a fictional U.S. port city located on the north-eastern Atlantic coast. It was originally a stand-in for New York City, but has also resembled other crime-ridden urban centers such as Chicago and Detroit. Some sources, including Mayfair Games' authorized (but now out-of-print) Atlas of the DC Universe, have placed Gotham City in the state of New Jersey. Christopher Nolan's Gotham City is located in the middle of the estuary of the Liberty River, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean. The river separates most of Gotham from the mainland. The River Merchant divides Uptown from Midtown, while Midtown is separated from Downtown by the Gotham River. The Narrows is a small island in the Gotham River. A creek divides the district of South Hinkley from the rest of Gotham City. Gotham International Airport is in Pettsburg, to the north of the Liberty River estuary. The current DC Universe version of Gotham City is separated from the mainland by the Gotham River, bridged by a series of bridges and tunnels. The east and south sides of Gotham face the Atlantic Ocean. The city is further divided by the Sprang River (named for Dick Sprang) on the northern end and the Finger River (for ) to the south. Tiny Blackgate Isle to the south-east is home to Blackgate Maximum Security Penitentiary. (Blackgate is replaced by Stonegate Penitentiary in the animated series Batman (1992-1995) and its spin-offs.)Batman Begins and The Dark Knight both have scenes that were filmed in Chicago. It has been noted by some sources that people watch these movies just to see what Chicago landmarks they can recognize. Some examples in The Dark Knight are as follows: the US Post Office entrance on Van Buren Street portrays the Gotham National Bank in the opening robbery. The car chase midway through the movie passes through a number of different environments like Lower Wacker Drive (where most of the action happens), through various parts of the Loop, and even a scene of the Batpod traveling through Millennium Station (you can even see South Shore Line signs). Various scenes in the movie were filmed on South LaSalle Street, including parts of the car chase, the funeral procession scene and the stunt where the semi-truck was flipped—the large tower at the end of the street is the Chicago Board of Trade. After wrapping in Chicago, the production headed to Hong Kong. \"The filming locations will include the Central-Mid-Levels escalator, some parts of Queen's Road Central and The Centre,\" notes the newspaper The Standard.

      "question": "How did the Joker come to be 'the joker'?",
      "answer": "From the beginning of the comic series created by Bob Kane & Bill Finger, the Joker himself never had an origin story. It might have been a deliberate move by the two authors to keep an air of mystery around the character.In The Killing Joke, a one-shot comic written by Alan Moore and drawn by Brian Bolland (released in 1988), the Joker is revealed to be a former engineer at a chemical plant who quit his job to pursue his dream of being a standup comedian. However, he was booed offstage after only one show and was left desperate to support his pregnant wife. He agreed to help a group of local crooks rob the chemical plant, but tried to back out after his wife was killed in a household accident. The crooks insisted, and made him wear a red mask, impersonating a well-known villain called Red Hood, so that if the police turned up, he would appear to be the ringleader. When, as predicted, both the police and Batman intervened, the engineer jumped into a vat of chemicals to escape, bleaching his skin white, dying his hair green and damaging the nerve endings in his face, resulting in a permanent, hideous grin. The pain and trauma he had gone through in just one day resulted in a psychotic break and he goes insane, hence the Joker's belief that it only takes one bad day \"to drive the sanest man alive to lunacy.\" However, this is all open to interpretation. The Joker himself fully admits that he's lied about it so often, even he isn't sure what truly happened.In this film, it's made clear that a freak accident hasn't made him look like a clown. He wears make-up (Happy and Dopey's conversation at the beginning while breaking open the control panel on the roof offers proof), and we can see the makeup change throughout the movie, as he sweats it smears and flakes off. In the scene where he fires at the mayor while disguised as a member of the honor guard, we see him without his makeup line. As for his scars, the Joker gives two conflicting explanations for them. One version, which he tells to Gambol before killing him, is that his father slashed his cheeks open as a child after he (the Joker) took his father performing the same act on his mother \"too seriously.\" Later, when the Joker and his henchmen crash Dent's fundraiser, he claims to Rachel that his wife was scarred by the loan sharks and that he cut his own cheeks with a razor blade to prove to her that scars did not matter. He starts to tell Batman a third story about how he might have been disfigured before Batman interrupts him. It is very possible that none of these statements are true. The ambiguity adds to the mystique of the Joker as a nobody who comes from nowhere and keeps the audience guessing.Most common theory is that Joker is ex Special Forces (Navy SEAL etc). This is backed up by his experience in hand to hand combat, experience with weapons and explosives, resistance to interrogation, high speed driving of various vehicles, ability to infiltrate and exfiltrate unseen. It is implied he was badly injured whilst on deployment and now has severe PTSD."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is there a new Batsuit?",
      "answer": "The suit was changed both for story and production reasons. During the production of Batman Begins, Christian Bale and the stunt men were constantly in danger of overheating because of the dense nature of the foam latex used to create the suit. It was also difficult for Bale to move, rotate, or to show expression in the head and neck area. Bale also complained that the original suit gave him a crushing headache every time he put the suit on. The suit also damaged easily. The new suit is made of polyurethane; it's a lot cooler and more durable, despite the increase of eight pounds. In the movie, Bruce Wayne asks Lucius for a new suit that will allow him to turn his head (which, he comments, will make it easier to back out of the driveway) and also protect him from dogs (referring to a prior attack). Lucius warns that increased agility means an increased vulnerability to bullets and knives because the plates that make up the suit have gaps in between."

      "question": "What was the purpose of each step in the bullet/fingerprint analysis?",
      "answer": "Step by step:1. Batman takes a piece of concrete containing all the pieces of the shattered bullet since that is what he will need at the end.2. The gunshots were to test different bullet types in hopes of finding what type of bullet was used by matching the hole size made in the concrete and the wave patterns between the two blocks of concrete through sonar.3. Once the bullet type was determined, Fox's new type of sonar imaging was used in visualizing the bullet fragments and allowing them to be recombined to match the known bullet type. Why the image could be gathered at the new Batcave but only be pieced together at Wayne Enterprises is unclear; it is a plot point which allows the sonar device to resonate an image of a fingerprint since the oil found on someone's skin would not be picked up that easily (or clearly) by a soundwave.4. The fingerprint is matched to all possible suspects who have their fingerprints on file.5. Of the four, the one they chose (Melvin White) had a known address which was on the procession route for the funeral march."
    },
    {
      "question": "Who is Melvin White?",
      "answer": "Melvin White, at the time of discovery, is assumed to be the real name of the Joker (since Wayne thinks that the Joker is the one who loaded the bullet), but White turns out to only be one of the Joker's assassins. The Joker called 911 to lure the police to the apartment where Richard Dent and Patrick Harvey were killed. Certain fans have questioned how The Joker would know that Batman would:A. Take over a crime scene from police in order to collect evidence.B. Specifically focus on a bullet.C. Somehow have the technology to recombine a representation of the bullet and the fingerprint on it.D. Know that of the four fingerprints found, the one belonging to Melvin White would be the one presumed to be him, andE. Have the discovery of the apartment so perfectly timed that Batman would enter the apartment at the exact time a certain timer would go off.However, it's possible that Batman's discovery of the apartment, as well as all other evidence, was not part of the Joker's plan at all, since Batman would have thwarted the assassination plot if he had discovered the hostages sooner. It appears that Batman discovers the apartment too late and simply arrives in time to witness the chain of events set in motion by the Joker. The egg timer, the window shade, and the scope were a diversion for the snipers, giving the Joker an opportunity to assassinate the mayor. (This seems the more likely explanation, as the Joker well knows that the Batman comes out at night only, and not during the day-this is alluded to in his scene with the mob meeting.)"
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does Gordon take off the Joker's handcuffs?",
      "answer": "Gordon most likely knew exactly what was going to happen when letting Batman take over the interrogation. He probably thought it would be seen as too unfair to have Joker handcuffed while Batman beats on him. Besides, it is common (at least in movies) when a prisoner is in an interrogation room to remove the handcuffs. The prisoner is in a securely locked room. The gesture is meant to relax him and give him the impression that the police officer is doing him a kindness (which is why Joker assumed it was part of the \"good cop/bad cop\" routine—Gordon's line about going to \"get some coffee\" being a classic representation of the concept)."
    },
    {
      "question": "What exactly is Batman's \"one rule\"?",
      "answer": "Batman's \"one\" rule is to not be an executioner. The explanation to this is found in Batman Begins - when Bruce chooses not to kill a criminal, and instead sets fire to the home of the League of Shadows. Bruce states to Ra's al Ghul, \"I will not be an executioner;\" even if the act of setting the fire might itself have led to one or more deaths (he himself even believes he has killed Ra's), it is not a deliberate act of murder. He does not violate this rule in Batman Begins, as he says it in a different way when he says he doesn't have to save Ra's al-Ghul. He leaves it up to al Ghul to get out of the doomed train himself. He may or may not have caused deaths in Dark Knight; for example, Batman rams the Batmobile into the garbage truck that one of the Joker's men was driving, which caused it to be pancaked into the ceiling of the tunnel. There's an extremely high chance the driver of that vehicle was killed. Also, Batman flips over the Joker's transport truck that he and his henchmen were riding in, which very well could have and might have killed some of them. None of these would be considered \"executions\" in Batman's view, as Batman's intent was not to kill Joker or his men, but to stop the truck from reaching Dent. By contrast, Batman does not mow down the Joker in the street immediately afterward. Had he done so, he would have had the clear intent of killing the Joker: an execution.Likewise, Batman does not intend to \"execute\" Harvey Dent: he intends to prevent the death of Gordon's son, and in the process, knocks Dent off the side of the building. From this perspective, then, Batman does not violate his one rule at any time, even if the situations in the film present a very fine line between \"execution\" versus \"killed incidentally\".In Batman's line of work, collateral damage caused by his enemies or himself are almost assured. So if Batman's \"one\" rule was simply to not kill people, then he'd have to be significantly more timid and by extension, less effective in his actions to stop criminals. The majority of his actions in these films could very well lead to people dying, even if it wasn't his direct intention. For example, Batman throws Maroni off a building from about 3 stories up. Batman was \"counting on\" the fall not killing Maroni, but people have died from much shorter falls."

      "question": "Why was Stephens guarding the door from the inside of the interrogation room rather than from the outside?",
      "answer": "It's likely because they wanted eyes on the Joker at all times. There didn't appear to be any cameras inside the interrogation room (just the two-way mirror that was smashed). It's also possible they didn't want him to escape through the broken mirror."

      "question": "Did Detective Stephens die?",

    {
      "question": "How does Two-Face come to be \"two-face\"?",
      "answer": "Harvey Dent is kidnapped and tied up. He falls over while trying to escape, which knocks over a gas barrel, spilling its contents and splashing some on his face. As Batman saves Dent from the building rigged by the Joker, it explodes. Both narrowly escape, but Dent is burned as fire shoots out from the explosion and ignites the fuel. In the hospital, Dent demands that Gordon say the nickname given to him (Dent) when he was working with Internal Affairs. Gordon replies, \"Two-Face.\" Dent adopts the nickname as his own. Grief-stricken by Rachel's death, traumatized by his injures, frustrated with criminal injustice in Gotham, and stripped of his vanity, he becomes a callous and deranged vigilante. The Joker also has a hand in helping Two-Face form his new criminal identity/behavior.The comics have a different origin for Harvey Dent. Dent gives testimony in court against a mobster named Salvatore Maroni, who appears in this movie. Maroni tosses a bottle of acid at Dent's face. Batman comes in to prevent the throw, but he only succeeds in saving half of Harvey's face. Dent later steals Maroni's good luck coin, and uses it to decide if he will be good or evil. This was depicted in the original Detective Comics. The Jeph Loeb/Tim Sale graphic novel, Batman: The Long Halloween, has a slight variation. Maroni still scars Dent, but Sal has help from a corrupt assistant DA. He manages to smuggle the acid in a bottle he claims contains antacids to treat a nonexistent stomach ulcer. Harvey inherits the coin from his abusive father (In the film, Harvey's coin also comes from his father, but there's no mention of whether he was abusive.) In the film, Maroni still attempts to have Dent killed in the courtroom, but employs a (ultimately defective) gun instead of the acid; this was possibly included as a nod to the original comic version."

      "question": "If the Joker is \"a man of his word\" as he keeps claiming, why does he keep screwing people over?",
      "answer": "Mainly, because the The Joker is a liar and a psychopath. The Joker has a twisted set of principles. He will twist his words so people will believe him, but the result will not favor anyone but him. He deceives the mob because he is disgusted by how they only care about money and not the chaos and anarchy he loves so dearly. For example, he finds the money as he promised the mob he would. Then he sets fire to \"his half.\" However, given the fact that all the money is piled together, the rest of it would burn as well. He told Batman where both Rachel and Harvey were being held hostage as he said he would, but he switched the addresses. He tells Dent that the kidnapping was \"nothing personal\" and we later find out that it was the Joker's intention to lead Dent specifically to insanity."

    {
      "question": "When Gordon says, \"Five dead,\" to what/which five is he referring?",
      "answer": "Gordon says, \"Five dead, two of them cops.\" A definitive answer is impossible. Christopher Nolan, when asked about an answer during a Blu-ray Live Event, responded, \"I will answer this question one day. But not today.\" Here is a list of whom he could have meant:1. The cops guarding Harvey Dent at Gotham General Hospital. One cop radios a second cop, who is guarding Dent's room. The guard cop does not reply, so the first cop goes in to check out the situation. The Joker shoots him and presumably has already shot the guard. That's two cops right there and it's possible that Gordon assumed that Two-Face killed them when he left the hospital not realizing it was The Joker.2. Detective Wuertz. Killed in the bar.3. Detective Anna Ramirez. While Two-Face lets her live, he knocks her out. She would have been missing. Gordon, knowing she's the one who drove Rachel, might have assumed she was dead. Or, less likely, Dent inadvertently killed her-although he intends to let her live, she could have been severely injured (e.g., head striking pavement) after being knocked out by Dent, and subsequently died.4. Maroni's bodyguard. As soon as Maroni walks out of the building, and then walks around to get in the passenger side of his car, look to the left of the screen on the driver's side of the car. The bodyguard standing there is grabbed and pulled off-screen. (It's very fast and very quiet so don't take your eye off that guy.) Harvey could've also simply knocked him out in order to quickly get into Maroni's limo, and Maroni was too distracted to notice him doing that.5. Maroni's Driver. Shot by Two-Face while driving along the scrapyard.6. Salvatore Maroni. Not certain. Two-Face flips his coin and spares Maroni's life. He flips his coin again and tells Maroni that his driver isn't as lucky as he is. Two-Face puts his seat belt on and shoots the driver, causing him to crash and flip the car. While Two-Face walks away from the crash unscathed, we never find out what happened to Maroni. Most likely he was either killed in the crash because he wasn't wearing his seat belt, or left Gotham and went into hiding afterwards. Either way, he isn't in The Dark Knight Rises.7. Harvey Dent. Gordon could have meant Dent himself, because in The Dark Knight Rises the public is under the impression that Batman murdered Harvey Dent in cold blood. It is never mentioned who else that Batman had supposedly killed.8. Bartender. A far-fetched theory, but here it is. When Two-Face went into the bar to kill Wuertz, the bartender went to the bathroom. Seconds later, we hear Two-Face walk out of the bathroom. Two-Face might have also killed the bartender to get rid of a witness. Note that Two-Face always obeys the flip of his coin no matter who the person is or what they might have done wrong. If this did happen, the reasons the scene might have been cut are: it was too violent for a PG-13 film; it was too early for Two-Face to kill an innocent person (it would have been his first murder); Christopher Nolan wanted him to be a tragic character and therefore wanted to focus on him taking revenge on the people who ruined his life, rather than on him killing an innocent bystander.9. Cop guarding Gordon's apartment. Also a bit far-fetched, but when forced to call Barbara Gordon, Ramirez refers to cops that are guarding the Gordons, and tells Barbara that they're not to be trusted. After letting Ramirez off, Dent might have killed them in order to ensure that they didn't stop the Gordons from leaving. Note that during the phone call, Ramirez stated that she could distract the cops long enough for the Gordons to leave-but Dent then strikes her and presumably knocks her unconscious. If so, then Gordon is not referring to Wuertz-implying that Gordon did not know Wuertz had been killed.However, since Gordon was in the observation room during the interrogation scene, where the Joker told Batman, \"You didn't disappoint; you let five people die,\" fans could argue it could be the five people the Joker killed: (1) Brian Douglas, \"a Son of Batman,\" (2) Judge Surrillo, the judge presiding over the mob trail, (3) Commissioner Loeb, the man in charge of Gotham P.D., (4) Patrick Harvey, Gotham police officer, and (5) Richard Dent. The flaw in this argument, as far as comparing this to Gordon's final statement to Batman after Dent's death, is that it's a matter of record that the Joker killed these other people or had them killed in league with Maroni, and Batman's \"letting\" them die was simply a matter of Batman not turning himself in and revealing his true identity, at which point the Joker would have retreated (though Rachel thinks not). Gordon is referring to people who have died after Dent's disappearance, and whose deaths might be traced to Dent. And remember that by that time, Rachel was already dead, which would have upped the Joker's death count to six. Another possibility is that the deaths were off-screen in some way. The Joker says that he wanted to see what Batman would do, after putting out his ultimatum to turn in his mask, or \"people will die\". So, the five deaths in question would be those that took place after this happens. At this point of the story, the five dead, then, would be five of the police who were escorting Dent to the County Jail. The two guys in the helicopter, the cop the Joker shot in the face from his truck, and presumably two more from the chase scene (likely the two in the car he shot with the RPG). The Joker says that Batman let these people die because he didn't really turn himself in, and the Joker knew it. This would also explain how all the dead would be friends to the police."

    {
      "question": "How does the Joker manage to get so much done so quickly?",
      "answer": "The obvious answer is that he had been spending the last six months (since the ending of Batman Begins) carefully planning out everything so that he would be ready. For example, the Joker blows up a hospital. Most likely, he had set the explosives in place long before. This is a trait very typical of the comic book Joker—he's able to prepare a crime for a long time and yet carry it out before anyone realizes what he's up to. He then \"predicts\" a crime that has already been committed. Another possibility, since Maroni's (and the mob's) goals mesh well with the Joker's social experiments, is that he gets a considerable amount of assistance from the mob after the Chechen puts out the word that he should be hired to get rid of Batman."

      "question": "How does the movie end?",
      "answer": "Two-Face threatens to kill Commissioner Gordon's son, James Jr (), while forcing Gordon to assure his son that everything is going to be all right, just as Dent had to do the same for Rachel while knowing it wasn't. Suddenly, Batman appears and tries to talk him out of it, explaining that the Joker chose Dent in order to prove that even the best of men could fall. Two-Face shoots Batman, who falls to the floor, then turns his gun on James Jr. Suddenly, Batman wooshes up, grabs James Jr., and knocks Two-Face over the edge of the building. The fall kills Two-Face and causes Batman to fall, too. Gordon rushes down to see if Batman is all right. As he picks himself off the ground, Batman tells Gordon that the Joker cannot win and offers to take upon himself the responsibility for the five people ('two of them cops') that Two-Face killed. Batman then flees from the scene. Flash-forwards are shown of Gordon praising Dent at a memorial service, Lucius erasing the cell phone grid, Alfred burning Rachel's letter to Bruce, and Gordon smashing the Bat-Signal. The final scene returns to Gordon and his son standing over Two-Face's body. James Jr asks his father why Batman is running away, because he didn't do anything wrong, and Gordon replies: Because we have to chase him...He's the hero Gotham deserves but not the one it needs right now. So, we'll hunt him because he can take it...because he's not our hero. He's a silent guardian, a watchful protector, a dark knight. Edit"

      "question": "What really happens when Batman is given the choice to save one person or the other?",
      "answer": "At a pivotal point in the film, Batman is given two addresses and told that he can only save one of the people, those two people being either Harvey Dent or Rachel Dawes. Batman leaves the station and says he is going for Rachel. Commissioner Gordon leaves the police station to rescue Harvey.One interpretation: The Joker, knowing Batman will choose Rachel (\"The way you threw yourself after her\" suggests the Joker was aware of Batman's affection for Rachel), has lied. He switched the addresses. Thus, while Batman intended to save Rachel, he \"saves\" Harvey instead. The Joker needs Harvey alive for his \"ace in the hole\". Meanwhile, the police, having heard the Joker's confession, race to save the other party. But for some reason (perhaps the Bat-Pod is faster than a squad car, or one address is farther than the other), they don't arrive in time, and Rachel dies in the explosion. The goal is that Harvey would survive, Rachel would die, both would talk before the end, and both had the potential to be saved (though the Joker was able to time the events so that only Batman would save one person quickly enough) so Harvey would think Gordon had failed him.Another interpretation: The Joker had switched the addresses knowing that either outcome would benefit him. If Batman had made the \"right\" choice and gone for Harvey (thus finding Rachel), Harvey would die; and Gotham would be left without its \"White Knight\". The public would hold Batman responsible, turning them against their protector. This is less likely, as Harvey's death probably meant very little to the Joker: being the mastermind he was, Harvey's death would be an easy task for him, but corrupting him beforehand takes more skill, with greater final effect: the final scene of the film shows Harvey (although dead) being presented as Gotham's Saviour, meaning the idea he lived for could continue. Knowing that he had killed \"five [people], two of them cops\" would undo that work, so Harvey had to be around to commit the murders. It is said at the end of the movie that Rachel died at 250 52nd street, where dent was supposed to be. So the joker switched the addresses."

      "answer": "Rachel wrote to Bruce, telling him that she has chosen Harvey Dent over him. Alfred destroyed the letter to stop Bruce from getting his heart broken. This is an important point in the film: the truth hurts. Gotham's spirit depends on the lie that Batman had killed the people that were really victims of Two-Face, and Bruce's ability to cope with the situation depends on the hope that Rachel would wait for him. Sustaining the lie was the key to being able to stay strong after the events of The Dark Knight. Though destroying this letter does have consequences in the following film, The Dark Knight Rises."

Warner Bros. restructured its marketing campaign to focus more on Batman. Up until Ledger's death, it had concentrated on the Joker. But the Joker didn't disappear from the campaign. Trailers for the movie still included him and posters for the film still had his signature line, \"Why so serious?\" Ledger's death did not affect the U.S. release date, which was July 18th, 2008.

Batman Begins referenced the comic book stories Year One, Long Halloween and Man Who Falls. The Dark Knight will continue the Long Halloween's idea of an alliance between Batman, Harvey Dent and Jim Gordon and make reference to such Joker stories as \"The Joker's Five-Way Revenge\" (from Batman #251), The Killing Joke and The Man Who Laughs. Look for many references to The Killing Joke and The Man Who Laughs. Christopher Nolan handed a copy of each to Heath Ledger prior to filming in order to prepare for the role. The title of this film is taken from a nickname that was first bestowed upon Batman in the comic book Batman issue #1 (Spring 1940). Frank Miller, whose work inspired Nolan in Batman Begins, also used the term for his 1986 comic book mini-series, The Dark Knight Returns."

Additionally, IGN.com is running a story of what they would like to see on the DVD. Promotional photographs also showed evidence of a more violent cut. When the body of the fake Batman is found the Joker card is stuck to the body using a knife. In the film it was just a paper clip. Nolan also confirmed that during the interrogation scene, a small bit was cut where \"...Christian dropped him and then, almost as an afterthought, he kicked him in the head as he walked out of the room.\" He said this was cut for artistic reasons rather than to tone down violence, making it unlikely to be added back in for any kind of extended cut.

In the film, the order in which they kill each other is:1. Happy shoots Dopey in the back with a suppressed pistol after Dopey disables the alarm.2. The bank manager shoots Chuckles in the back with a shotgun.3. Grumpy shoots Happy in the head once Happy opens the vault.4. The bus driver runs over Grumpy.5. As the bus driver wonders what happened to the other guys, the Joker guns him down with an automatic pistol.The first two went as planned, but assuming the bank manager didn't shoot Chuckles and the bus driver didn't run over Grumpy, it's likely that Chuckles would have killed Grumpy (as Grumpy already shot Happy). Then the bus driver would have killed Chuckles and in the end, the Joker would have still killed the bus driver. However, the Joker is a highly intelligent psychopath, so he is able to plan everything out meticulously. Therefore, the events in the actual robbery may have worked out exactly how he had planned: knowing that the bank was a mob bank, he knew that the manager likely would have had a weapon stashed in his office, so he had Chuckles stand guard with his back to the office so the manager would shoot him. Then he had Grumpy place the money in an area too close to the doorway so the bus would run him over."

      "answer": "The pencil penetrated through one of the thug's eyes (although this is not explicitly shown), as the vulnerable eye is the only possible \"point of entry\" for the pencil to make an instant kill. Death would result from either the force of the eyeball, the pencil, or both breaking the bone directly behind the eye socket and forcing it into the brain; alternatively, the pencil itself could have penetrated straight through to the brain. Then again, for moviegoers who can't suspend their disbelief, the pencil itself could have been one of the Joker's deadly props. The Joker, throughout the character's history, has always had a supply of normally harmless items turned deadly, such as playing cards that are razor-sharp and flowers that squirt acid. The present Joker proves to have the same fondness for malicious gadgets right from the beginning, when he sticks a gas grenade in the bank manager's mouth. This seems especially plausible given that an ordinary pencil could not be jammed into a table, as the Joker does, without the pencil breaking and thus no longer able to stand up for the Joker's \"trick\"."

Even though it's not a canon part of the Nolanverse, Louise Simonson's novelization of the animated Batman: Gotham Knight provides a reasonable explanation of how Bruce was able to modify his penthouse apartment in The Dark Knight (boldface added for emphasis): Despite a recent effort by an ex-CEO to take the company public while Bruce was out of the country and presumed missing, Bruce had managed to buy up the majority of the stock. He continued to own the controlling shares in Wayne Enterprises, which had given him a great deal of leeway when it came to remodeling the corporate headquarters.The Wayne Enterprises building took up an entire city block. It rose in art-deco splendor into the skies of Gotham, just as splendid, in its way, as the taller Aparo Tower. It was one of Gotham's indespensable hubs of financial power and a vital center for public transportation.

      "question": "When Gambol is playing pool, he has five guards; yet after the Joker jumps up from the pool table he only has three. What happened?",
      "answer": "Two of Gambol's men place the Joker's body on the pool table. The other three were escorting the men who supposedly \"killed\" the Joker. When the Joker jumps up from the table, we see him reach out with both arms, obviously killing the two men who put him on the table by stabbing them. This then raises the question as to how he stabbed both of them and managed to get a perfectly clean knife up to Gambol's mouth. But let's not forget that the Joker carries multiple knives at all times and that he is very fast, as he managed to get the upper hand on Batman twice in the film."
    },
    {
      "question": "What does the Joker mean by \"try-outs\"?",
      "answer": "The Joker explains that he will let one of the three remaining thugs from Gambol's gang join his gang. \"So,\" he explains, \"we're going to have ... try-outs.\" He breaks the pool cue in half, looks at the now sharp end of one half, and drops it between the three men. \"Make it fast,\" he says, as he leaves the room. Gambol's men are shoved to the ground, and as they recover, they all look at the broken cue, then at each other. He who is the first to grab the pool cue and kill the other two gets to work for the Joker. While later scenes give no additional insight into what happens offscreen, it's generally accepted that the term \"try-outs\" when used in most contexts (e.g. baseball tryouts, etc.) refers to testing the abilities of an individual as relates to the goal they are seeking (or in this case, having forced upon them)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How exactly did Gambol die from the Joker's knife?",
      "answer": "The Joker has his blade in Gambol's mouth, threatening to cut his cheeks. And presumably he does, off camera. There is a belief among some fans that you can't die from having your cheek slashed, but it is possible; laceration of the face was listed as a cause of death in the infamous Black Dahlia murder. The shock and blood loss could cause death. It's also possible that the Joker got carried away and went beyond cutting Gambol's cheeks. Since the murder happened off camera, we don't know.On the other hand some suggested that Gambol did not die at all. Since the action is off screen, Gambol might be playing dead to hide from the Joker's and the thugs' attention after being cut at the mouth/cheek."

      "question": "How does Batman, being a normal human with no superpowers, break the gun of one of the fake Batmen?",
      "answer": "Batman uses some sort of hydraulic hand device to snap the gun. If you listen, you can hear a mechanical noise as Batman bends the barrel of the gun. He also uses this same device on Scarecrow's van. He tries to rip a hole in the side in an attempt to apprehend the villain. After the device jams, Batman is slammed into a wall and Scarecrow almost escapes. Batman then jumps onto his van from a few stories up, and crushes it. He captures and ties up the Scarecrow, his henchmen, and the fake Batmen. This is the only time we see this device used, as he gets a new suit shortly after."

      "question": "How did Batman and Rachel survive the fall from the penthouse?",

    {
      "question": "How does the Joker plan to escape the interrogation room if he had no one to talk to inside it?",
      "answer": "Since the room isn't soundproof, the Joker could have simply lured someone to him by making a ruckus (like trying to break the glass, for example) and start talking to whomever is on the other side of the window. Not to mention, with shards of broken glass everywhere, there was a much higher risk of him possibly harming himself, which the Joker clearly isn't afraid to do, given the smile on his face. All he needed was his phone call. Which was his legal right. So even if he didn't demand the phone call by force, they likely would have given it to him eventually."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where does the Joker get the knife that he uses to take Stephens hostage?",
      "answer": "It isn't a knife. It was a piece of glass from the two-way mirror that broke when Batman slammed the Joker's head into it. This can clearly be seen in either the IMAX theater or the Blu-ray disc. It's far too large to be concealed in a shoe, and it has an extremely reflective surface facing out."
    },
    {
      "question": "Was Detective Stephens corrupt?",
      "answer": "No. Out of Gordon's unit, he was the only one Gordon truly trusted. Stephens was the one who checked the vitals on Gordon after he was shot by the Joker. Therefore, he knew Gordon wasn't dead. If he were corrupt, he likely would have told Maroni that Gordon's death was faked. Gordon also trusted Stephens to guard the Joker in the interrogation room. But Stephens let his temper get the better of him, and the Joker was able to take him hostage to escape."

    {
      "question": "How could the Joker time the bombs so perfectly to ensure that the police cannot save either Harvey or Rachel without knowing exactly when Batman is going to interrogate him?",
      "answer": "It's possible that the bombs were remotely activated only after Batman and the cops were seen rushing out of the Major Crimes Unit. Hence, the Joker's claims about having \"only minutes left\" may have been instructions to his men to detonate both bombs if they didn't see Batman or the police rapidly leaving the building by a certain time. Also, they may have been told to detonate the bomb for whichever building the police arrived at, before they entered. The timers on the bombs may have just been a fail-safe, had Batman tried to locate and neutralize any spotters, he wouldn't have had time to rescue whichever target he went after.It's also possible that the Joker didn't truly know that it wasn't possible for the police to rescue the other hostage, but was simply intending to make Batman have to choose to only rescue one of them personally. Given the abilities of Batman's vehicles, it wouldn't be unreasonable for him to assume that Batman would make better time than the police, and thus waited to reveal his hand until after it was likely that no police cars could make either location in sufficient time."

    {
      "question": "Could a person's face burn like that and survive?",
      "answer": "Not exactly. While the film tries to keep the characters relatively realistic, it still requires us to suspend our disbelief. The left side of Dent's face is soaked in diesel fuel, which is ignited, completely burning and charring the skin on the left side of his face. His left eyelid is completely burned away as well as most of his cheek, exposing his jaw muscles and the inside of his mouth. This is the unrealistic part: burns that deep would need more prolonged exposure to heat than what would be provided by a thin layer of accelerant on the skin, especially given the fact that Batman was present to pat out the flames. While there are no vital arteries to be destroyed, he would be in an unimaginable amount of pain. Given the pain, grief and trauma Harvey suffers, it's not difficult to imagine him going insane. Harvey's internal battle, as depicted in the comic books, is the battle between his evil, revenge-driven half and his sane, compassionate half, hence his new name, Two-Face.While a person could reasonably survive the burning, it is worth noting that it is not possible to leave the muscles and eyeballs exposed without the tissue becoming highly infected and necrotic (dying). Immediate surgery and skin would have been required. Harvey also makes facial expressions that are not possible, since his muscles are so badly damaged. It's also not possible for him to speak as clearly as he does, since half his lips and cheek are missing. Moreover, third degree burn victims are also highly susceptible to infection. They are kept in \"burn units\" in hospitals where the air they're surrounded with can be controlled. Nevertheless, it's not difficult to suspend our disbelief for the character, especially when he exists in a comic book fantasy. Many viewers put down his survival and ability to function to an adrenaline rush. It's also worth noting that the character does not live for very long after the accident, so his ability to survive in the long term need never be a problem in terms of realism. Dent even says \"You think I want to escape from this?\" then gestures to his burnt face and says \"There is no escape from *this*!\". So it seems that Dent knew he was a dead man by leaving the hospital and simply wanted vengeance before his passing."

      "question": "How does the Joker get half of the mob's money when he hasn't even killed Batman?",
      "answer": "The Joker has himself arrested so as to get to Lau and discover the location of the money. After doing so, he has all the money and is therefore in a strong position to demand his fee."

    {
      "question": "How did Batman equip every cell phone in Gotham with the sonar technology?",
      "answer": "Bruce Wayne indicates to Lucius Fox that he has budgeted a large amount of money to a government telecommunications project. When Lucius asks, Bruce indicates that he is \"playing this one pretty close to his chest.\" The audience can only assume that this was all part of a plan that Bruce had, knowing the technology would come in handy against the Joker. (Later in the film, it becomes clear why Bruce did not tell Lucius, who is upset by Batman's spying.) It is not known exactly how Batman equipped every cell phone in Gotham with sonar technology. It is simply presented as possible, in order to advance the plot. In order to assimilate or approximate a three-dimensional space, sound waves must come in consistent stereo pairs; cell phones have a single speaker for resonating sound and a single microphone for receiving sound. Further, in order to process sound differently than they are equipped, the cell phones would need to have both their hardware and software upgraded. It is highly improbable that Bruce, even with a government telecommunications project, would be able to forcibly upgrade the cell phones of every resident in Gotham simultaneously without a single person noticing. Therefore, we can assume that it was a gradual process that Wayne started as soon as he realized the implications of the sonar technology. He could have simply provided the upgraded phones to Gotham citizens purchasing new phones. After all, Americans/Westerners usually upgrade their cellphones every two years. Over a period of months or even weeks, a significant number of Gotham citizens would have them. If the cell phone was a significant technological advance, people would have been lining up to buy new ones regardless of the age of their current phone. Just look what happened when the iPhone was made available.Another strong possibility is that the project had nothing to do with new phones, merely new phone software. As anyone who buys a cell-phone knows, you can easily download software applications to your phone; the phone company that carries your service also can download software to your phone, and in fact does so when initializing a phone for activation. Wayne's project may have been software that was distributed to cell phone users across Gotham, and designed so that it would not be known to the phone users that new software had been installed. This explanation makes sense in context: Lucius states that Wayne has \"converted\" every phone in the city, not replaced the phones with new ones. And Batman relies on the Joker using a cell phone that would send a signal-which would only make sense if Batman had distributed software to every known number in the city, and not had to rely on the Joker buying a new phone."

      "question": "How did the Joker manage to get the upper hand on a trained fighter like Batman in two different fights?",
      "answer": "In the first fight, in Bruce Wayne's penthouse, Batman was fighting multiple opponents at once. The Joker stood back and observed the best time and position from which to attack. Still, he didn't exactly get the upper hand on Batman. In the final fight at the end of the movie, the Joker sends Rottweilers to attack Batman. While Batman is trying to fend off the dogs, the Joker starts frantically beating him with a pipe. This causes Batman's sonar to malfunction, leaving him blinded and open to attack."

      "question": "Why did Batman save the Joker in \"The Dark Knight\" and not save Ra's al Ghul in \"Batman Begins?\"",
      "answer": "Ra's al Ghul was responsible for being on the monorail and he also is the one who destroyed the controls in the belief that Batman was trying to stop the train, when in fact, destroying the controls actually aided Batman in his plan. Batman threw the Joker off of the building himself. In the first case, Ra's put himself in the situation which resulted in his death, whereas in the second case, had Batman not saved the Joker, he would be solely responsible for murdering him. Doing so would have been a violation of his one rule, \"I will not be an executioner.\" It is also possible that Batman was trying to prove to the Joker that he was incorruptible. The Joker even makes it a point after Batman saves him to say \"You truly are incorruptible.\""
    },
    {
      "question": "Why pin Two-Face's crimes on Batman?",
      "answer": "A number of reasons:1. When Dent had Gordon's family at the place where Rachel died, the police had a border already set up. By this time, Joker was in custody. Had they blamed Joker, everyone would have known they were lying. That would prompt an investigation into the other deaths. Batman and Gordon wanted to preserve Dent's image as the \"White Knight,\" giving the citizens of Gotham hope.2. Batman wouldn't want to falsely pin crimes on even someone like the Joker.3. After the events of The Dark Knight, Batman can no longer allow himself to be affiliated with Gotham Police without risking more deaths. By \"rebranding\" himself, he not only severs all ties to authority, he is also \"becoming the villain.\" As Dent is allowed to die a hero, Batman must accept the opposite responsibility. (i.e. Dent's phrase, \"You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.\")4. Harvey Dent is a leading prosecutor. If word was to get out that he's a crazy killer, all the crime bosses in prison would have sufficient grounds for appeal. All the convictions of all the cases Dent has ever tried could be overturned, and all the crime bosses would be back on the street. The movie mentions this a few times. In their first meeting, the mayor cautioned Dent that he had better watch himself, because all they need is a little dirt on him and all the cases would crumble. During the scene where Dent threatens the fake honor guard who was actually a paranoid schizophrenic, Batman warns Dent that killing him would put all the cases in jeopardy. Batman reiterates this to Gordon at the end.5. During their final confrontation, the Joker explains that Batman's weakness is his adherence to rules. Why abide by a code when your enemies obviously don't? Pinning Two-Face's crimes on Batman is sending a message to the public, and it's not a terribly positive one. This also plays into his psychological dilemma evidenced by the line \"I've seen what I have to become to stop men like him.\" (Another possible interpretation in this vein is referenced earlier in the film. The point is made that the criminals are not scared of Batman because they know he won't kill, making him less effective. By pinning Two-Faces crimes on Batman, it changes that perception, striking even more fear into the criminal mind.)6. Giving Batman a villainous public image should prevent any further copycat batmen harming themselves and others.7. Since he began his fight on crime, Batman has, inadvertently, become the glue that holds Gotham together. Alfred tells Bruce after the Joker shows up that he can't quit, and that he would have Bruce endure because he can make the choices no one else can make. The decision to take the fall for Harvey was the only way to keep the crime bosses/criminals from being released from jail and to keep the city inspired. The personification of Batman is the only image/symbol strong enough for Gordon to use, which could convince the people of Gotham to believe the story that Batman, not Harvey, was responsible for those deaths. It would not have been very convincing or ethical to blame those crimes on another person/criminal. This was Bruce/Batman's way to be whatever Gotham needed him to be."

    {
      "question": "Why did the Joker turn Harvey Dent into Two-Face?",
      "answer": "Harvey Dent's role in the film is to be presented as \"the perfect guy\" (or rather, \"Gotham's White Knight\"). He is an honest person bent on fighting corruption to make a better future for everyone, and was trusted by Batman, the Mayor, and Gordon, as well as earning some affection from Rachel. This \"perfect\" person is used by the Joker to make a point to Gotham. With all of the people's spirit based on Harvey as their saviour from the climate of fear created by the Mob, his corruption would make \"their spirit break completely\", which is the Joker's prime intention. He knew that Batman would go after Rachel when given the choice, so switches the addresses, and Harvey is pulled out of a building alive, with the one he loves dying instead. The Joker then visits him in the hospital to shift the blame off himself, and leaves Dent to descend into insanity, killing cops and, later, innocent people. As is seen throughout the film (those most explicitly in the ferry scene), the Joker wants to turn good people into bad people, to make \"fair\" chaos. By taking \"the best of us\" and \"tearing him down\", the Joker can show that everyone can be corrupted. The Joker saves his final act for Batman. Although it can be said he didn't break his one rule with Harvey Dent, it is quite obvious that he pushed both him and Gordon's son off the edge of a building, saving only the son. Everyone is eventually corrupted by the Joker."

      "answer": "He was tied up on top of the money pile that the Joker slid down. He is never seen being taken down before the Joker lights the pile on fire. We can assume he was burned up with the money. The scene finishes before the fire reached Lau, so no screams or man-on-fire is shown, probably in an attempt to keep the film's rating at PG-13."

    {
      "question": "Didn't Batman violate his code of not killing his enemies?",
      "answer": "There is no definitive answer. Some say Batman broke his code; others say he did not. The answers hinge on interpretation of intent and outcome. Some argue that even if Batman accidentally kills one of his foes, it is still a violation of the code, while others argue that an accidental killing does not count.One interpretation: Batman did break his one rule in order to save Gordon's son, which is what the Joker prophesied earlier in the film by saying, \"Tonight you're going to break your one rule.\" However, the Joker's initial plan was to get Batman to kill the Joker himself; showing that everyone is corruptible. Batman beat him and showed that the Joker couldn't force him to break his rule. Later, Batman chooses to break his rule by killing Two-Face. The moral is that Batman won't be forced into doing anything by a maniac. He chooses to do the right thing even though people might hate him for it.2nd interpretation: Batman pushed Two-Face away to save Gordon's son, but Two-Face wouldn't let the boy go. Batman's choice was to save Gordon's son and let Two-Face fall or vice-versa. Batman chose to let Two-Face fall; but he didn't kill him.3rd interpretation: No, Batman did not violate his code. At the end of Batman Begins, his final words to Ra's al Ghul were, \"I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you.\" When faced with the choice of saving the innocent or bringing the guilty to justice, Batman will always choose the former. Had he stopped the train, the water under Wayne Enterprises would have been vaporized as well, with catastrophic results. With regards to the next question, there were still innocent lives at stake when he chose not to save Ra's. In the Joker's case, there was no imminent collateral damage for Batman to consider. Therefore, he could safely apprehend Joker without causing innocent people to be harmed, which was the completely opposite course of events the Joker had intended.4th interpretation: Batman killed Two-Face by accident. He did not mean to actually kill Two-Face when he tackled him, but merely meant to overpower him and lost control in the scuffle. Seeing as how an innocent life was at stake, Batman simply acted on reflex to protect the innocent (Gordon's son) and miscalculated the amount of strength necessary to take on Two-Face, leading to his death."
